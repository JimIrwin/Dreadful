<h2>Tracking the Amalco Portfolio</h2>
<p>Latest <span style="font-style: italic;">screenshot of the portfolio</span>. Portfolio value now is $C 1,225k which is $457.551k below the target value of $C 1,683k.<br><span style="font-size: 75%;">Grant-Thornton puts the ACB at $C 1,082k which suggests a target capital gain of $C 601k with a tax-bill of $150k and a target net portfolio value of just over $C 1,500k. <br>The ACB used in the spreadsheet is the target price, so that the column "$ Unrealized Gain/Loss" shows the gap between the current and target values for the holdings. These are red because values are below target.</span></p>

<h3>Stocks nearest to target </h3>
<p>Apple, ticker <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL">AAPL</a>. Current target is $172 for $US 60k ($C 81k) from 350 shares. Target last seen 2022 August, also March. Peak price was 2021 December, over $180 (about 5% over current target)</p>
<p>Royal Bank, ticker <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/RY.TO">RY.TO</a>. Price now is 13% below the current target: $143 for $C 57k from 400 shares. Target price last seen 2022 January (most of the month). Except for 2021Dec through 2022March, a price of $125 looked good ($100-110 in 2020 and 2021). 52-week peak was $149.60; solid dividend over 4% and low-risk.</p>
<p>Pfizer, ticker <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE">PFE</a>. Price now is 14% below the current target: $US 55 for $US 110,000 from 2,000 shares. Target price last seen 2022 April (1 day); over $58 2021mid-December. Nasdaq is still down about 27%, so maybe we can expect better than the current target, when Nasdaq recovers. If so, if target is met while Nasdaq is still slumped, maybe we sell 1/2 at the target, holding the rest for a bounce from a Nasdaq recovery? Solid dividend over 3% and low-risk.</p>
<p>TD-CanTrust, ticker <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/TD.TO">TD.TO</a>. Price now is 14% below the current target: $102 for $C 41k from 400 shares. Target price last seen 2022 Jan and Feb.  Until 2021 March, a price of $85 looked very good ($60-65 for much of 2020); over $93 2021Nov to 2022May. Solid dividend of 4% and low-risk.</p>
<p>Telus, ticker <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/T.TO">T.TO</a>. Price now is 15% below the current target: $34 for $C 27k from 800 shares. Target price last seen 2022 April.  Except for 2022 Feb to May, a price of $30 looked very good ($22-26 before 2021 June).  We are hoping to match the 2022 peak, which may prove overambitious. But it is not a large holding, and it has a very solid dividend of 4.8% and it is low-risk.</p>
<p>CiscoTelus, ticker <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/CSCO">CSCO</a>. Price now is 18.5% below the current target: $US 56 for $US 95k from 1,700 shares. Target price last seen 2021 December (and briefly over $63). Jim's guess is that we won't get to target before the Nasdaq improves a lot (e.g. 14,000 vs 11,000 now) Decent dividend (3%). </p>
