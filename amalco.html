<p>Pfizer (<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE">PFE</a>) now is within 1% of the current target ($US 55 for $US 110,000 from 2,000 shares). Target price last seen 2022 April (1 day); over $58 2021mid-December. Nasdaq is still down over 1/4, so maybe we can expect better than the current target, when Nasdaq recovers. If so, if target is met while Nasdaq is still slumped, maybe we sell 1/2 at the target, holding the rest for a bounce from a Nasdaq recovery? Solid dividend over 3%. Perhaps we will boost that target to $60 (9%) or more, reasoning that we expect the<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC?p=%5EIXIC">NASDAQ</a> to move up more than 25% when it recovers (past 14,000 from around 11,200 now). </p>
<p>Next closest to target are <p>Royal Bank <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/RY.TO">(RY.TO)</a>, 10% below target ($C 57K) and CISCO <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/CSCO">(CSCO)</a>, 12% below target ($US 95K).
</p>
<p>We have some large holdings of US stocks that are more than 30% below target: Google (down 32%), Citigroup (down 34%), and Carmax (down 50%).

<br><span style="font-size: 75%;">Grant-Thornton puts the ACB at $C 1,082k which suggests a target capital gain of $C 601k with a tax-bill of $150k and a target net portfolio value of just over $C 1,500k. The ACB used in the spreadsheet is the target price, so that the column "$ Unrealized Gain/Loss" shows the gap between the current and target values for the holdings. These are red because values are below target.</span>

<h3>Stocks nearest to target </h3>
<p>Royal Bank, ticker <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/RY.TO">RY.TO</a>. Price now is 11% below target $143. Target price last seen 2022 January (most of the month). Except for 2021Dec through 2022March, a price of $125 looked good ($100-110 in 2020 and 2021). 52-week peak was $149.60; solid dividend over 4% and low-risk.</p>
<p>TD-CanTrust, ticker <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/TD.TO">TD.TO</a>. Price now is 13.5% below target ($102). Target price last seen 2022 Jan and Feb.  Until 2021 March, a price of $85 looked very good ($60-65 for much of 2020); over $93 2021Nov to 2022May. Solid dividend of 4% and low-risk.</p>
<p>Pfizer, ticker <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE">PFE</a>. Price now is 14% below the current target ($US 55 for $US 110,000 from 2,000 shares).

<p>Telus, ticker <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/T.TO">T.TO</a>. Price now is 16% below the current target: $34 for $C 27k from 800 shares. Target price last seen 2022 April.  Except for 2022 Feb to May, a price of $30 looked very good ($22-26 before 2021 June).  We are hoping to match the 2022 peak, which may prove overambitious. But it is not a large holding, and it has a very solid dividend of 4.8% and it is low-risk.</p>

Target price last seen 2021 December (and briefly over $63). Jim's guess is that we won't get to target before the Nasdaq improves a lot (e.g. 14,000 vs 11,000 now) Decent dividend (3%). </p>
