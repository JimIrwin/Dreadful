<h4>Logan (2022 JEP) "American Enslavement and the Recovery of Black Economic History"</h4>
<p> Not much use for SSMM-slv us (hints of interest in material conditions of life). Refers to Fogel's (1975) 3 phases   (1) profit/viab/southernecon  2) micro of slavery -- TOTC, gang labor  3) recovery of black history</p>

<p>p85 Here, I want to focus on a different aspect of these disputes over the technological status of enslaved-based Southern agriculture: namely, the way in which the assumptions needed for quantitative economic modelling can blur into unwarranted and unsupported assumptions about underlying cultural and social patterns.    ... Fogel and Engerman (1974), as part of their effort to explain the high levels of productivity they found in Southern plantation agriculture, argued for a cultural model of enslavement that would be consistent with its high level of productivity.</p>

<pre><code>The obvious attributes of slavery—forced extraction of effort, slow work, resistance, and violence—seemed incompatible with high levels of output produced. </code></pre>

<p>Therefore, the Fogel and Engerman model was built on highly productive enslaved workers who responded to “positive” labor incentives, were adequately fed, clothed, and housed, were sexually prudish, who were infrequently punished, where family breakup was rare, and who, overall, exhibited a “Protestant work ethic” that led to the high yields seen in the productivity calculations. <p86> It is difficult to imagine these arguments being made today, and this social model of enslavement has not endured. It was the subject of intense debate and embarrassing refutations of the evidence used to support many of these claims. John Hope Franklin (1980, p. 521), the doyen of African American history, noted that Fogel and Engerman “make claims for the mitigating factors in slavery than they are unable to prove."
<br><i>Ji finds 8th ed. quote:</i> "Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman make greater claims for the mitigating factors in slavery than they are able to prove." <br> Gutman (1975, p. 2), a social historian of enslavement and the Black family, was more forceful:   ... " poor social history, that its analysis of the beliefs and behavior of “ordinary” enslaved Afro-Americans is  entirely misleading, that it uses a thoroughly inadequate “model” of slave socialization, ... "
<br><br> Ji: largely sensible to dismiss the cultural/social history dimension of TOTC ; but challenge remains to make sense of high productivity
</p><p> then more Gutman ...
<br>
 A Black economic history requires dealing with, principally, Black people, Black culture, Black institutions, Black consciousness, and the appropriate historical context    ... Economic historians have not and do not principally deal with questions that arise from the narrative record, nor do they interface with Black culture, Black institutions,
</p><p>
The cultural and social model of enslavement presented in Time on the Cross remains a cautionary tale for the limits of quantitative history in general and economic history in particular</p>

Alongside that data, we can return to the central question: What did Black people know and how did they know it?
