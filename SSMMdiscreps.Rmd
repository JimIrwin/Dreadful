## Data Discrepencies to Decode ##

<p>1850 SR is much higher in PUMS than in census volumes.
E.g. whites
SR(1to4) PUMS 103.7  Census 103.3  +0.4
SR(0yrs) PUMS 103.9  Census 103.4  +0.5
SR(1yrs) PUMS 105.2  census N/A
SR(2yrs) PUMS 103.8  census N/A

South Atlantic PUMS 0 is 0.7 above census; 0 is +0.7 1to4 is +0.4 above census; and age 1 has SR 108.1
Possible revision is to use SR3 -- aggregation reducing noise? (see MakingBestJudgements.xls)

... u5 is 0.5 high -- what if we simply used PUMS minus 0.5 ?
 

Most of the divergence of our census-based estimate versus the PUMS is because we assume the SR(1-2) is the same as the SR(1-4), but in the PUMS the latter 1.5 points higher.
To make them comparable, we can use the PUMS's proportions of age1 in ages 1to4 for males and females. Census is still lower, but they are more comparable. Alternatively, we could deem the PUMS erroneous, and use the same 1/4 of 1to4 as the age1 estimate in PUMS and cenVo.

<p>Jim to propose estimates of 1890 U2 by region, accepting the U5 values, but reshuffling among ages by distributing girls-by-age from a life table, then distributing boys via ?
DETAILS: 1890 census age-question was newly worded, and the 1900 and 1910 census volumes include discussion of the resulting problems in counts at age 0 and 5 (far fewer than usual at 4, extra at 5, because age at nearest birthday take 4.51 yrs to 5). I thinking we take the 0to5 or 0to4 population, and allocate it to ages
to replicate a life-table pattern consistent with the observed over 0to5 (U5+5) sex ratio. For example, New England's 1890 SR06 is 102.0  and the SR5 is 102.1  -- we'll use the latter (against my prior, that lower makes more sense in 1890).  209,170 u5girls.
