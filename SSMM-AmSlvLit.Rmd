    The obvious attributes of slavery—forced extraction of effort, slow work, resistance, and violence—seemed incompatible with high levels of output produced.

Intro    
p2 To varying degrees, slaveholders materially “provided” for their dependents by usurping that patriarchal privilege from black men.^4 Wilma Dunaway argues that Mountain South masters had an incentive to inadequately feed and clothe their slaves, leading to higher levels of malnutrition and mortality than in the Lower South.

In his study of three rice-growing plantations in South Carolina and Georgia, William Dusinberre notes of Gowrie plantation, “child mortality devastated these families, so that the most common nuclear grouping was a husband and wife with no surviving children.” Dusinberre, Them Dark Days, 84.

If the market and mobility frequently separated children from their par-ents, so too did high mortality caused by strenuous labor, physical punish-ment, and malnourishment.24p305n24 Compared to the general slave population, Dunaway finds that slaves in the Mountain South were 1.4 times more likely to die due to inadequate provisioning of food and clothing, malnutrition, overcrowded housing, poor sanitation, and occupational hazards.

p4  In essence, this article argues that the tremendous catch-up growth experienced by slaves is inconsistent with Steckel’s assertion that slave birth weights, a proxy for health in utero, were incredibly low. Adaptive theories of human growth suggest that poor conditions in utero have long-lasting effects on the growth pattern of children, especially in limiting catch-up growth. Thus, it is more likely that slave children experienced relatively good conditions in utero and had higher birth weights than Steckel argued.

p128      One of the more important discoveries is that the century-long decline in the mortality of U.S. slaves probably came to a halt during the 1810S or 1820s and then began to rise ...  plantation records indicates that the death rates of infants rose by about 24 percent between the 1820s and the 1840s

p145 It thus appears that diets sufficient to maintain the health of nonpregnant women engaged in heavy labor were insufficient to produce average weight gains in pregnant women that would yield adequate average birth weights and forestall high infant death rates.

  These voices recount experiences that are representative of a majority of slaves of the Mountain South, ... low black population density and small plantations. What they have to say is startling b/c they are reporting a past that contradicts the dominant paradigm. The conventional wisdom is that owners rarely broke up slave families; that slaves were adequately fed, clothed, and sheltered; and that slave health or death risks were no greater than those experienced <p2> by white adults.
