### demography of slavery/Blacks

#### summary of IMRs

Steckel's 350 (used in HSUS); 

Eblen used by Baptist?

Steckel (1986 SSH) recaps previous IMR's:  Eblen (1972, 1974) 246-275; Farley (1970) 274-302; Evans 1962 182.7; Postell 1951, 1952  152.6 (1817-61);      
p428 Thomas Afflick's remark "Of those born, one half die under one year"



 
Digital History 2021  Slaves suffered extremely high mortality. Half of all slave infants died during their first year of life, twice the rate of white babies. And while the death rate declined for those who survived their first year, it remained twice the white rate through age 14. As a result of this high infant and childhood death rate, the average life expectancy of a slave at birth was just 21 or 22 years, compared to 40 to 43 years for antebellum whites. Compared to whites, relatively few slaves lived into old age. 
 






#### slave/Black demography

#### Steckel & related work 

2017 Schneider EHR    epigenetic: good conditions in utero -- foster catch-up growth after a dreadful childhood     
p4  In essence, this article argues that the tremendous catch-up growth experienced by slaves is inconsistent with Steckel’s assertion that slave birth weights, a proxy for health in utero, were incredibly low. Adaptive theories of human growth suggest that poor conditions in utero have long-lasting effects on the growth pattern of children, especially in limiting catch-up growth. Thus, it is more likely that slave children experienced relatively good conditions in utero and had higher birth weights than Steckel argued.







Punchline: Steckel's work is very sloppy, and his IMR estimate is built from slim evidence ... so how do we handle that?

p397  Prior to emancipation, masters may  have provided some care for pregnant  women and infants, since additional slaves  usually meant capital gains. The absence of  such care after the war and the general  decline in health conditions probably pro-duced the higher infant mortality rates  indicated by the population models, and <p398> it is likely that three out of every ten  babies died before age one.  Quasi-stable population techniques have used to assess the fertility and mor-tality levels of the nineteenth-century Negro population. The results indicate that health conditions generally deterio-rated in the second half of the last cen-tury, while fertility, in the absence of any regulating institutions, remained very  high, producing a rapidly growing popu-lation

       ... There was nothing the planter was more interested in than the increase of his slaves through the birth and rearing of children, and within the bounds of medical knowledge of the period, he took the time and effort to promote conditions that were conducive to the rearing of large families.      
      The first care of the planter was the prenatal care of the mother. Rules were drawn up by the planter and overseers were instructed in the care of the expectant mother. Crude as this care was in comparison to our knowledge today it was still far superior to anything the Negro had known in Africa, and it compared favorably with the medical knowledge of the ante-bellum period.

        p539    Since the mothers were too valuable as field hands to be permitted to remain home after they were well enough to return to the fields, the responsibility of caring for the infants was the duty of the "children's nurse." 


Low % infant deaths in first week/month? which he interprets as successful breastfeeding and then diarhea (bottle-fed?) One example of infant/child food sounds pretty bad, and like Steckel says, doesn't include meat ...

Hacker (2020 SlvAbol)  ** high IMR implies high 
  Thus, despite using somewhat different methods and assumptions, most researchers agree that birth rates for the black population were in the range of 50-60 births per thousand population in the early nineteenth century.  ...   n11    ...   If Richard Steckel is correct that age pattern of slave mortality did not conform to the age pattern of white mortality—compared to the white population, slave infant and child mortality rates were elevated relative to adult slave mortality rates —birth rates derived using stable population methods and Jacobson’s life table may be too low. Given that the estimated nineteenth century birth rates are already near 60 births per thousand, however, it is difficult to see how much higher slave birth rates could have been. Richard H. Steckel, ‘Birth Weights and Infant Mortality among American Slaves’, Explorations in Economic History 23, no. 2 (1986): 173-198.

In  the Natchez District of Mississippi, slaves cultivated solidarity in ways that created not one community but many.
      There, the name that slaves put to the grounds of solidarity was not ‘community’ but ‘neighbourhood’. They imbued the term with social as well as geographical meanings that were as rich as they were precise. Slaves defined neighbourhood in terms of adjoining plantations because that was the terrain where they engaged in the relations of power – labour, property, kinship, discipline and sociability – that constituted their society.



JonesJaq 2010/1985 *Labor of love, labor of sorrow : black women, work and the family, from slavery to the present*      
xv   One of the criticisms of the book when it was first released was that it presented an overly sentimental view of black families s (as revealed in the title, as well as the text), oblivious to the realities of husband-wife and parent-child relations, especially as those relations played out in households under great stress. I agree with that criticism, up to a point. Yet the story told here focuses not on the social or psychological dynamics of black households, but on the historic forces that have shaped the labor patterns of black women at home, in communities, on antebellum plantations, and in the paid labor force. This edition supports the view that as a group, black working women through history have made heroic exertions to provide for their families and to resist the dehumanizing effects of a marketplace undergirded by white-supremacist ideologies.

  These voices recount experiences that are representative of a majority of slaves of the Mountain South, ... low black population density and small plantations. What they have to say is startling b/c they are reporting a past that contradicts the dominant paradigm.

p54 Slaves devised a structure of intimate relations that enabled and obliged them to collaborate with and discipline both slaveholder and neighborhood.  ...

p74 Slave marriages across plantation lines comprised somewhere between one and three of every ten marriages, studies of the Works Progress Administration narratives suggest, and the proportion was higher in some states, such as South Carolina.99 <n99 Escott 27.5% {but that refers to different owners, could reside/work in same plce (rentals, relatives own)} ; Crawford 10.4% ; emily West extrapolated 19% from Crawfod and estimated 33.5% for SC;  Escott (1979 Remembering), Crawford    West  *Chains*

p77 Indeed, no tie bound the neighborhoods of southwestern Mississippi more tightly than marriage. After the wedding, often a neighborhood event, the husband became a fixture over at his wife’s quarters. The proximity of adjoining plantations facilitated more frequent visiting than was possible in an ‘‘abroad marriage,’’ which typically permitted couples to spend weekends together. In the Natchez District, some married men had a standing pass to spend one night during the week, usually Wednesdays, as well as Saturdays and Sundays with their families.∞∞π Edward Hicks beat the path every day between his cabin on Oak Ridge and his wife’s, only three-quarters of a mile off on the adjoining Grant place.118 {edward Hicks, absalom Grant, case 5516}


saidiya Hartman *Scenes of subjection: terror, slavery, and self-making in 19th america* Highly influential. A view of US slavery that makes the high levels of production quite mysterious? Emphasis on violence generally and sexual violence more narrowly. Sometimes gives a sense that emancipation did not make much difference?    
(2022 edition)  I intended to bring into view the ordinary terror and habitual violence that structured everyday life and inhabited the most mundane and quotidian practices. This environment of brutality and extreme domination affected the most seemingly benign aspects of the life of the enslaved and could not be eluded, no matter the nature of one's condition, whether paramour, offspring, dutiful retainer, or favored nursemaid. {field hands' relative autonomy?}   
      With the advent of Emancipation, only the most restricted and narrow vision of freedom was deemed plausible: the physical release from bondage and the exercise and imposition of the contract ... In the aftermath of slavery's formal demise, the old relations of servitude and subordination were recreated in a new guise.    ... the nonevent of Emancipation ... 

 The plantation was hell, factory, killing ground, Sodom. In attempting to explicate the violence of slavery and its idiom of power, *Scenes* moved away from the notion of the exploited worker or the unpaid laborer toward the captive and the fungible, the commodity and the dominated, the disposable and the sexually violated, to describe the {25} dynamics of accumulation and dispossession, social reproduction and social death, seduction and the libidinal economy, and to highlight the vexed relation of the enslaved to the category of the human. ... Slavery was the blind spot in critical theory n5  ... Conservative scholarship ... denied the magnitude of the violence required to produce the human commodity and reproduce the relations of master and slave, and replicated the assumptions of romantic racialism and the plantation pastoral by describing slavery as a paternal institution characterized by reciprocity and consent, "Aunt Jemima in Dialectics" n6  The work of radical historians and intellectuals was devoted to refuting such assertions and celebrating slave agency, excavating slave culture, demonstrating black humanity and resilience in the face of dehumanization, recognizing the enduring totality of African beliefs and values despite the rupture of the Middle Passage, and fundamentally challenged the idea of the damaged person or pysche produced by centuries of enslavement. ... vitality of black culture, the autonomous zones created in the slave quarters and the provision grounds, and the strength of the black family. 

Hartman (1997)
Intro:  The period covered thus extends from the antebellum era to the end of the nineteenth century. Despite the amazing tumults, transitions, and discontinuities during the antebellum period, Reconstruction, and the Gilded Age, I feel this scope is justified by the tragic continuities in antebellum and postbellum constitutions of blackness.    
p10 Notwithstanding the negatory power of the Thirteenth Amendment, racial slavery was transformed rather than annulled. As suggested earlier, this transformation was manifested in debt-peonage and other forms of involuntary servitude that conscripted the newly emancipated and putative free laborer, an abiding legacy of black inferiority and subjugation, and the regulatory power of a racist  state obsessed with blood, sex, and procreation.

p198 It is not my intention to argue that the differences between slavery and freedom were negligible; certainly such an assertion would be ridiculous.

p145 It thus appears that diets sufficient to maintain the health of nonpregnant women engaged in heavy labor were insufficient to produce average weight gains in pregnant women that would yield adequate average birth weights and forestall high infant death rates.

{intro to 2nd reflects back} p xv the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of ***Slave Culture** appears against a backdrop of inattention by historians to the arts and American slavery that not even Douglass’s genius has yet reversed. We may take solace, however, from the fact that the judgment of most American historians con-cerning such matters need concern us no longer. They now stand practically alone in denying African influences that have steadily been demonstrated by scholars in anthropology, art history, linguistics, music, literature, dance, and still more disciplines.    
xvii  {highlighting Frederick Douglass on music/song} He sometimes thought “the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of slavery, than the reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject could do.” His insights on the social implications of slave music should be of lasting interest to artists and intellectuals at the highest reaches of American life.     
Intro ... p15 quotes Herskovits:  In all those parts of the New World where African religious beliefs have persisted, moreover, the river cult or, in broader terms, the cult of water spirits, holds an important place.

p33  {Va & Md}  Born into slavery in 1843, Simon participated in the most sacred of rituals in the 1850s by the age of thirteen—a common practice in slave communities in both the North and the South, as children, within a year or two after they were able to walk, joined in some ceremonies, especially in the ring shout. In fact, slave culture was, despite its centeredness upon the elders and ances-tors, a culture in which the very young played a more vital role than scholars
have assigned them.
p42 {re Simon Brown} In the 1850s, these youths participated in burial customs common to Central and West Africa, customs known to vast numbers of slaves, although by then second- and third-generation Africans greatly outnumbered those born in Africa.   ... Brown tells us that slaves helped each other in illness as in death. If a woman fell ill, “other women came over to help her with the chillen, or to cook the meals, wash the clothes or to do other necessary chores.”      ... Sometimes a man or woman with a healin’ touch would brew a herb tea, mix a poultice, or apply peach tree leaves to the fevered brow, to help the sick git well. All of this lovin’ care cheer’ up the trouble’ soul, whether he got well or died."
p220   ... Among Negro peoples a man’s name is often identified with his very soul, and often with the souls of ancestors. Parents name children after rela-tives, heightening the spiritual significance of their names, all the more after the death of a relative. The efforts of some West Africans, the Ashanti and Yorubas among them, to bring the living and dead closer, thereby lessening the pain of death, is illustrated by their rituals on the death of an elder and the birth of a new member of the family. The placing of food on the burial mound or at the crossroads and the naming of infants after the deceased are related means of seeking renewal and approbation from the spirit of the dead, and were no doubt carried out by many for that dual purpose in slavery even when non-African names were given to infants    ... Since Ashanti in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina joined Kongo peoples and numerous other groups in the same locations in practic-ing West African burial ceremonies during slavery,

p70 Ceceil George emphasized the inadequate time accorded field hands for maternal care when she observed that most women resumed their field duties a mere nine days after giving birth, either leaving their infants with plantation nurses or rushing back to their quarters to provide occasional suckling.
p72 Birth intervals on other sugar estates further indicate that women delivered infants every twenty-five months and that a period of sixteen months elapsed between delivery and successful conception of the next baby. This phase was significantly foreshortened among mothers who lost their child in labor or soon after delivery.    ... The relatively short birth intervals for slaves in Louisiana suggest that planters followed Affleck's strictures and sought to maximize the reproductive potential of their bondswomen by limiting suckling-or else that the high rates of infant death and the destructive effect of the sugar industry impaired breast-feeding.     ... slave women in the cotton region experienced birth intervals of thirty-four <p73> months      
p73 Slaveholders valued their enslaved offspring and attempted to maximize the reproductive potential of their predominantly male estates, but they had to weigh their immediate labor requirements against lower workloads during the final trimester or during postpartum recuperation. Most sugar masters favored labor over leave, keeping their pregnant women in the fields and offering little respite from the sugar order. During the latter stages of pregnancy, women were occasionally assigned lighter duties-such as hospital work or maintenance of the slave quarters-but during the main cultivation and harvesting seasons, they did not receive a substantial reduction in their workloads until the final trimester. 
p77 Despite importing thousands of slaves a year to the sugar region, Louisiana was unique among the slave states in having a natural decrease in its population.

p78   Historian Richard Follett has argued that many sugar planters “favored labor over leave” and kept pregnant women in the fields until shortly before they gave birth, especially on newly established plantations with limited work forces.25^[Follet Sugar Masters 73-75]  
Many of the wealthier and more progressive sugar planters, however, as many of those living in St. James Parish undoubtedly were, were keen to protect enslaved women in advanced stages of pregnancy from overwork, because overexertion in the stifling and unhealthy cane fields could result in miscarriage and thus endanger a valuable potential addition to their labor force.

If the market and mobility frequently separated children from their par-ents, so too did high mortality caused by strenuous labor, physical punish-ment, and malnourishment.24p305n24 Compared to the general slave population, Dunaway finds that slaves in the Mountain South were 1.4 times more likely to die due to inadequate provisioning of food and clothing, malnutrition, overcrowded housing, poor sanitation, and occupational hazards.

In these ways, white mothers were crucial to the commodification of enslaved women’s reproductive bodies, their breast milk, and the nutritive and maternal care they provided to white children.
