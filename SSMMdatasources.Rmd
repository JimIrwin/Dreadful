The Bulletin of the WHO, [2000, 78:1175-1191](https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(10)1175.pdf)   
U% mortality rate ... has a number of advantages over the infant mortality rate as a composite measure of health risks
at young ages. In particular, the indirect demographic techniques for measuring the under-five mortality rate are more robust and less sensitive to assumptions about the underlying patterns of mortality than the infant mortality rate (28, 29) 
Data obtained from the complete registration of births and deaths provide the best possible basis for the direct estimation of child mortality. Unfortunately, such data are available for only 55–60 countries.d

<br>In all these areas the mortality schedule was withdrawn from the enumerators. In all others they were directed to report deaths, and their returns ... compared with the reg records. The result of the comparisons, ... indicated that registration was defective in many places where it was supposed to be perfect, a considerable percentage of the deaths reported by the enumerators not being found in the reg record. As the enumerators did not report more than 50 or 60 per cent of the deaths, the presumption is strong that the omissions in the registration record were even greater than indicated.

To think about: if 11mo olds are rounded up, how does that distort the SR1? It would seem to leave more of the younger, who are more male ...

### US Census for the Black SR1 ###
population volumes from 1850 and 1860 give U1, 1-u5, 5-u10 etc, for Whites, Free Colored Slaves.  Negro Population 1790-1915 Ch 4 provides SR1 for blacks 1850, 1860, 1870, 1900, 1910 and explains that 1880 and 1890 includes "indians, chinese, japanese" with blacks. So we need to extrapolate to fill in -- calculate non-white totals 

1940 can't find negro age 2 -- just nonwhite for single yr

Great quotation about SBR 106 and the frail male "At birth 106 males appear for every 100 females ...; yet, by the law of nature, -- a law seen in still more powerful operation even in intra uterine life -- the tendency to succumb under disease is so much greater in the male than in the female, that by about the 18th year of life the proportion of the sexes becomes equalized, 100 males being alive at that age for every 100 females"

Our british estimates: we accept 1901 forward from
[S92 NatArchives Database](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11521415). That 1901 value is 100.1 and we extrapolate back, based on the 1911 census Table 43, back from 1901 to 1861. CLRIFY THIS: 1911 census has 102.2 (graduated) and 102.1 (Table 43), both close to the S92 value of 102.0;  1901 value of 100.5 (1911Tab43,1901Tab16) 1901 census has 100.6 as the graduated estimate, 100.5 as the value Tab16 via fems/thousand males age 0, in 1901 and 1911 census.

London 1841 is given with and without Lewisham and Hempstead -- probably more rural-like, but too small to matter
"Original homelots were not divided up extensively until the 1840s, when enriched by the burgeoning whaling industry, New Londoners began to seek land for dwelling houses in outlying neighborhoods close to the center of town."
From Wikipedia The Official Illustrated Guide to South-Eastern and North and Mid-Kent Railways of June 1863, by George Measom, describes Lewisham as follows: 'Lewisham Station, situated on the slope of an eminence amidst picturesque scenery, beautiful green meadows rising abruptly to the summit of the hill on the left, dotted with handsome residences and gardens, while the Common is seen intersected by various cross roads and studded with country inns and houses on the low ground or valley to the right. The area of the parish is 5,789 acres... Lord of the manor, the Earl of Dartmouth to whom it gives the title Viscount'.

     some other cause is at work to produce so great a numerical inequality of the sexes: and the info so widely collected in late years, together with the fact that females are more numerous among Mahomedans than Hindoos, and among low castes than high castes, have forced Mr.Plowden (p3) to the conclusion that the disparity is mainly due to the wide prevalence of the practice of female infanticide, including in that workd not merely active deprivation of life but also neglect and disregard in the rearing of girls.

From 1881 census (Plowden p. 54)   
    the actual disproportion between the sexes, though it might exist to some extent, and to what extent it was impossible then to say, was not anything like so great as had hitherto been portrayed by the census statistics.
 ... the nearer we approach to accuracy in the Census of a general population, the more clearly does the fact appear that there is nothing peculiar in this country in the proportion of the sexes; that if there are from 104 to 106 females to every hundred males in Europe, this proportion also obtains in India, that is in all parts of the country where female infanticide is unknown. The truth is that the great bulk of enumerators have been singularly obtuse in comprehending the fact that the counting of females was a matter of any importance in census work. To understand how this is, we must take into account **the low estimation in which females are held in this country,** and also the reticence of the people on all matters connected with their female relatives. In the registration of births and deaths the same error obtains. **The birth or death of a female child is considered such an insignificant matter,** especially among the lower classes of the population, that a great number escape registration in certain districts; and, from the causes adverted, to the numbering of the female population in 1871 was undoubtedly erroneous in so far that many were omitted in the Census schedules. But in districts where the Census work was well done it will be found that the female population is invariably in excess of the male; in fact, the general accuracy of the results of any district may be judged of by the way in which the proportions of the sexes have been recorded."

p57 girls less-effected by the famine

p178  It is obvious that a wave of infecundity has during the last few years swept over at least Northern India, and that the five years between 1876 and 1881 have seen a far smaller number of births than took place between 1871 and 1875.
