Breschi et al fn 1: 1  The bibliography on infant and child mortality in Italy is very wide. For an overview, see: Del Panta, 1997; Pozzi, 2000; 2002; Pozzi and Robles González, 1997; Manfredini and Pozzi, 2004.


##### Italy regional data #####

Various scholars trash the stillborn data (before maybe 1930s?) but they seem to see the IMR data as valid. So we are left with anomalous results ... like 1936 Campania (in southern ITA) with f/m -4% with IMR 116 (and male mortality just 9.6% greater (Ln) ). And worse, Sicilian SR5 that is -8% female ...

It is tempting to use the comment about "extra caution" and data problems for Italian mortality as a basis for dropping the Italian SR:IMR set.  But the comment misleads about IMR data, which does have single year deaths (and original sources show u1month and u1year deaths, by sex).     
Jim kills a day poking around ITA 19th C data (and sources) to find that stillborns are a little lower than expected for the IMR (e.g. 30 per K livebirths while Prussia has more like 40 -- and they both have IMR around 200). But that does not seem to be a basis for challenging the Italian IMR. If we shifted infant deaths over to stillbirths to make Italy look like Prussia (raise ITA stillborns by 1/3) then 1870s avg IMR drops from 214 to 207 (1871 226 drops to 220) -- negligible.

**Regional differences in registration quality**  Pizzo & Barona quote Woods “Italy offers an excellent example of what we would expect to see in a country with improving registration coverage. National rates of late-fetal mortality only reached credible levels during the early decades of the twentieth century because regional differences in registration quality had narrowed by them. Rates in the south rose to match those in the north and then stayed at a higher level longer” (Woods, 2009, 82)."

LOOK AT BRESCHI REGIONAL IMRS and TRY TO LINK TO SR REGIONALLY ....

HMD  "ABOUT MORTALITY DATA FOR ITALY" (Last updated 2021 May 12)  Prior to 1906, deaths counts are available only by five-year age groups (i.e., 0-4, 5-9, …, 65-74, 75+), with the exception of 1883-84, when they are available for single years of age. The data for 1883-84 demonstrate clear patterns of age heaping. In 1893 and 1894, data are available only for the total number of deaths by sex (not by age group); the age distribution has been estimated (see Appendix II for details)     
p5 DATA QUALITY ISSUES     
The data prior to 1906 should be used with extra caution due to problems of quality. For most of these early years, the original death counts were available only by five-year age groups with an open age interval at age 75+ years. Thus, life tables by single years of age are based on estimates. Users are advised to use the life tables by five-year (or 10-year) age groups, which are based mostly on the original data rather than estimates.

For Jim, bottom line question is whether the IMRs are overstated. Do stillbirth data suggest anything? The fact that the male rate is only 10% above the female is interesting -- that is consistent with the sex-ratios being not-so-female-biased. This is all about Italy's SR data being inconsistent with the IMR values; e.g. 1881 Ln(u5f/u5m) = -3.7%   and IMR > 200.  My simulator predicts -3% Can't rule out mortal misogyny, but sex ratios by age do not show a shift toward boys (as expected in case of substantial excess female mortality).

Italian [digital stats pubs](https://ebiblio.istat.it/SebinaOpac/resource/annali-di-statistica/IST0030194?locale=eng&tabDoc=taboggd) incl one referenced in tab 2.3 which has different birth counts

##### Italy as a whole #####

U5 populations are on the Istat web-site with the same values as Mitchell's IHS. HMD's data has years are advanced by 1;  seems HMD refers to start of year and Istat end of year?  IMR values are on the Istat web-site; IHS (2013) has less precise version of the same.

At least for 1901, the under-5 age group embraces some 5-year-olds, insomuch as the census reported Feb 9, 1901 populations by year of birth; probably less than 1/12 of the 1896-birthyear were age 5 at the census-date. But one wonders how precise the census-takers and respondents were when doing the census.     

SRB is somewhat male-tilted, with Ln(m/f) values usually at or above 6.0% until the second half of the 1880s; values usually in the 5.5-5.9% range into the early 20th century; values range from 4.9% to 5.4% in the years from 1908 to 1916. Interesting to see births fall more than 1/3 from 1915 to 1917 and the SRB tilt 0.9% toward boys (presumably because the decline of births was concentrated among the poorer and less-healthy women).

The Istat data are in xls tables in the dempap/wrangling/raw folder.

For SR5 [Istat](http://seriestoriche.istat.it/index.php?id=1&no_cache=1&L=1) and IHS (Mitchell) have the same numbers for 1861, 1871, 1881, 1901 (no 1891 census). HMD numbers seem the same, but years are advanced by 1.

1881 census ["Sulla classificazione per età della popolazione del Regno](https://ebiblio.istat.it/digibib/Censimenti%20popolazione/censpop1881/IST400060cp1881sullaclassificazionexeta+OCR.pdf) offers various estimates of pop by sex and age for 1881 and 1871, along with discussion.

HMD has single-year by sex for 1872 forward -- source?
For the Human Mortality Database, we use data based on the presente population for years prior to 1981. Population estimates are calculated based on census counts of the presente population in order to be consistent with the vital statistics (i.e., deaths, births).    
HMD says, misleadingly, that death counts come 0-4, 5-9, ... but in fact the sources have 0, 1-4, 5-9 etc; and the 0 group is sometimes broken into 1month and 1-12months 

    Prior to 1906, deaths counts are available only by five-year age groups (i.e., 0-4, 5-9, …, 65-74, 75+), with the exception of 1883-84, when they are available for single years of age. For 1912-20 and 1937-51, the pre- and post-war census counts and deaths data for the total population (including the military) are used to derive annual (January 1st) population estimates.      

For 1912-21, 1937-51 (WWI, WWII), HMD "Italy, data sources" refers to Jdanov et al. for births & deaths, but that paper covers war-time mortality of young males.

YrBks corroborate Mitchell's u5 populations for 1880 1890 1900 1910 1925 1933 (Series A2, 2013:13pdf3454, 1983:45). Seems Alsace & Lorraine included 1871-1918 (But Js assures these are small).  Series A1 Germany (pdf3408) has fn24 (pdf3437); A1 has pops for those census years. 1910 has fn25 From 1910 (2nd line) the territories ceded after the First World War are excluded 
A2 is pop by 5-yr ages.  (2013:15pdf3454);  1933n13 p45pdf3484 Excludes Saarland.
A1 is census pops (2013:10pdf3407) 1910 has two lines, n25 ()

Mitchell gives a consistent series for IMR data for 1875-1900 ("five states"), but 1900-40 (Empire & Republic) is different.    

Our spreadsheet (IMR-SR.xls) refers to 1875-1900 series as D5S (5 states) and it is to be used for SRs from 1880-1900.  The subsequent IMR series is DER (Empire & Republic) and it is to be used for the 1910 and later German data.

Mitchell reports (pdf139, 2013:pdf3577) IMR from 1836 (292), but via footnote 3 (pdf146p127) 1836-50 is Bavaria only; 1851-70 is Bavaria and Kingdom Saxony;  1871-74 + Baden, Wurttenburg; 1875-1900 + Prussia; 1901-1940 German Empire & Republic.   fn7 
1875 IMR=242 but n9 1875 say IMR without Prussia 308 (1872-1874 values listed are 301 307 297)  so Prussia pulls average IMR way down. Knodel 1974 corroborates that, with Prussia IMR 1871-75 224 1876-80 205

The u5 counts in Mitchell match the Yearbook Vol 4. There  "Eheschliessungen, Geburten und Sterbefälle in den Jahren 1872—1881" (Marriages, births, deaths).

In the IHS listing of sources, the only reference to 1869 is Statistisches Jahrbuch der Österreichischen Monarchie (1861–1881). Those are linked in [this wiki](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Statistisches_Jahrbuch_der_%C3%96sterreichischen_Monarchie#1863%E2%80%931881:_Statistisches_Jahrbuch). Looking for age/sex: not 1868-1871;   (new format starts in 1872)  1872-1880 (has 1880 census); end looking.

u5 for SR have 1880 1890 1900 from 19C AUT sources; use IHS for 1869 and 1910; 2010 YrBk and IHS have 1923 and 1931 Republic of Austria

From Google Doc:  we have data for IMR by sex for 1875-1907; total IMR (Mitchell/IHS) 1908 onward. M & F u5 pops for 1880, 1890, 1900 from contemporary sources; use Mitchell for 1910 u5 pops (total matches OK with 1910 census as reported in 1913 Statistische Monatschrift.  Austria’s stats bureau has u5 pops for only a very small subset, smaller than offered by the Jahrbooks of circa 1900/1910).   
HMD’s ”Austria” is very small compared to 19C Austrian sources. 
Yearbook 1886 p3. has 1880 u5 pops 1449168 1465661, matches IHS/Mitchell (2013:pdf3440) has 1449 1466. The corresponding SR-values are 98.87 and 98.84 (so IHS rounds to .1 lower).
Page 5 has infants deaths, m & f, <1month, 1-12mos. HMD says “In general, the degree of completeness is high enough to classify Austrian birth statistics as being of high quality”.
HMD’s birth count for 1880s are only about ⅕ of Austria’s YrBk for 1886. From MItchell/IHS it seems YrBk does not include Salzburg.

Translation from Norwegian: The figures relating to the population on January 1, 1846, 1856, 1866, 1876, 1891 and 1901, rely on censuses, while those for all intermediate year is calculated.       
See below for more on this source.      

Careful of dating -- HMD data are for Jan 1 of the year stated, but StatsNorway gives same values as Dec 31 of the prior year. So there is a simple 1-year discrepency to be alert for.     

NOTE Timing issue. HMD year is (StatsNor +1); HMD is for Jan 1 and SN is Dec 31. So HMD u5 t should be associated with IMR t-1, t-2, ..., t-5. Magnitudes: *Norges folk* refers to census-based populations: "The figures relating to the population on January 1, 1846, 1856, 1866, 1876, 1891 and 1901, rely on censuses, while those for all intermediate year is calculated." (translated from Norwegian).

E.g. HMD for 1866 and 1971 are Jan 1 values, which show up as the 1865 and 1870 values at Statistics Norway Tab 05810 (which table has footnote "Until 1990 the figures correspond per 31 Desember. As from 1995 the figures correspond per 1 January.." )

u7 populations 1845-2021 in [05810: Population, by sex and age 1845 - 2021](https://www.ssb.no/en/statbank/table/05810); those years correpsond to HMD(year +/- 1?); thus the 05810's 1865 value is HMD's 1866 value.

HMD & Norgesfolkemængde have same timing; but many of the pubs refer to end of year (so HMD t-1)

HMD u5 is same data as Norges folkemængde, which states age/sex data is for the start of the year; e.g. u5 male 1866 117,026 -- that is the value reported for 1865 by Statistiske oversikter 1948 and by HMD?.  Census refers to Jan 1, 1866 (but pdf39p3 refers to 31Dec1865 pop 1,701,756 which is table 05810 value for 1865 .

FROM FRENCH: Since 1876 the age has been expressed year by year, but for years previous years into groups which have been divided by years using calculations approximate, based on the number of births over the years corresponding. Similar calculations have been undertaken in part also for the censuses of 1876, 1891 and 1900 in order to correct certain irregularities from ages shown in round numbers.

**IMR stats**  Use IHS 1876-1970.

1968 Hist Stats pp45-46 has IMR annually from 1836. But 1961 study authored by Backer (former Chief of Pop Division or such) indicstes that 1876 forward are reliable/valid. And 1978 Hist Stats p53 has 5-yr averages starting 1876 (not before). 1961 publication identifies likely errors in counts of miscarriages, stillbirths, and early-dead infants until the 1870s; and identifies 1876 as start of good data (in terms of stillborn vs eraly-dying). See below.     
<p>I dismiss HMD because HMD births data has m/f 106.00 for 1847-1915, except 1907 is 105.9948 -- I'm surprised they didn't tweak m or f by 1 ...
</p>

Ji calculated IMR via births and U1 deaths -- but the results are almost identical to those in IHS -- which is accesible to others.

p36 Ch2   Grunnlaget for dødelighetsstatistikken i Norge / The basis for mortality statistics in Norway.

vital stats (marr/bith/death) reg starts in 1685, with Priests.     
The registration of deaths with us has probably always been fairly complete,    

Siden 1797 er dødfødte barn blitt meldt til sokneprestene, men helt fram til 1870-årene var registreringen av disse mindre tilfredsstillende. Det samme gjelder for levende fødte barn som var døde like etter fødselen.  
*Since 1797, stillborn children have been reported to the parish priests, but until then In the 1870s, the registration of these was less satisfactory. The same goes for for live-born children who had died shortly after birth.*

Dette førte til at tallet på registrerte levende fødte og døde barn ble for lavt og tallet på dødfødte for høyt. De gjeldende bestemmelser om hva en skulle forstå med et levende og dødfødt barn ble imidlertid stadig innskjerpet overfor jordmødrene, og fra 1876 kan en gå ut fra at de tall som står oppført i den offisielle statistikk stort sett gir et riktig uttrykk for forholdet.
*This led to the number of registered live births and dead children being too low and the number of stillbirths too high. However, the current provisions on what to understand with a living and stillborn child were constantly tightened up for midwives, and from 1876 it can be assumed that the figures listed in the official statistics largely give a correct expression of the relationship.*

1866 summary lists were replaced by transcripts of the church books

p37 Starting with 1866, annual overviews of births, marriages, deaths in the resident population.  

LATER, assertion that IMR declined in 1840s and 1850s:  Den samlede dødelighet før og under fødselen og i første år etter denne var meget høy i slutten av 1830-årene, men falt så sterkt i de to følgende tiårsperioder og var relativt gunstig i 1856—60. 

The overall mortality before and during birth and in the first year after this was very high in the late 1830s, but fell so strongly in the two following ten-year periods and was relatively favorable in 1856-60.

Important note: the population data for New Zealand are complicated by different levels of data quality by ethnic group (Māori and Non-Māori). Due to recently discovered numerous inconsistencies in the early historical data for Non-Māori, we restricted previously published series of Non-Māori data to the period 1901 onwards (for more details see the ‘Data Quality Issues’ section below). Starting in 1901, data for the Non-Māori population meet at least minimal data quality standards. 

p4 There is some evidence that death registration was incomplete until the beginning of the 1960s. First of all, concerning Māori deaths, ... possible underestimation at older ages prior to the 1960s  ... In addition, Non-Māori neonatal deaths were seriously underestimated at least until the 1910s (by about 18% in 1876).   NO SOURCE GIVEN
p4 Due to very serious deficiencies of data on deaths before 1901, the series of Non-Māori mortality estimates begin in the year 1901. However, the user should be aware that the HMD estimates for the Non-Māori for the periods 1901-1921 and 1939-1947 should be used with extra caution (see the ‘Data Quality Issues’ section below).      
p7 Historical data on Non-Māori births are also problematic, especially before the 1910s (Statistics New Zealand, 2006). First, there was an underestimation of neonatal deaths, which was quite significant (about 18% in 1876) until the beginning of the 20th century. Second, some Māori births were registered as Non-Māori. Last, births of Non-Māori who lived among Māori were also generally unrecorded (Statistics New Zealand, 2006). 


p10 There is evidence that New Zealand censuses conducted before 1926 were affected by undercount and age misreporting problems (Pool, 1973). Pool (1973 Pop Studies), "Estimates of New Zealand Maori vital rates from the mid-nineteenth century to World War I". Page 121: "From 1911 on ages were published in quinquennial groups, but the I9I6 Census was noted to be poor both in terms of coverage and age-reporting, while by 1921 the 'half-caste' rule mentioned above was becoming unworkable."     
Very strange to challenge non-Maori census data via an article seeking to estimate Maori vital rates.

p9  Non-Mäori births understated when neonatal deaths occurred, probably until 1910s.
p12 2.1.4 Non-Mäori live births, 1876–1935
Although the birth registration system is believed to have provided an acceptable level of non-Mäori coverage, some adjustments to registration data were needed to estimate the number of non-Mäori live births that actually occurred in each year. The most signifi \cant adjustment was the addition of unregistered births when neonatal death occurred. The under-registration of neonatal deaths in New Zealand is recognised (eg Pool 1982, 1985), although quantifying the extent of registration is more difficult. The distribution of infant deaths by age (days at death) suggests under-registration of non-Mäori neonatal deaths before the 1910s and Mäori neonatal deaths before the 1960s. Based on mortality patterns at that time, roughly 80 percent of these unregistered neonatal deaths were likely to have occurred within the fi rst day of life. For infants who died soon after birth, it is likely that if their death was unregistered then their birth was unregistered also. The adjustments to neonatal deaths (see Section 2.2.4) were therefore applied to births. This corresponds to an increase in non-Mäori births of less than 2 percent in 1876–1911.

p2 Although the completeness of Māori data has improved, data quality problems remain important (see the section on "Data quality issues"). Furthermore, starting in 1962, these problems may have also been relevant for the Non-Māori data1     
p5 Historical population data on Non-Māori (prior 1930s) seem to have data quality problems at older ages (see section on ”Data quality issues”).     
p6 Due to poor quality of Māori statistics, births may be underreported or misreported until 1961     
p7 DATA QUALITY ISSUES     
1. Quality of data on population counts. There is evidence that New Zealand censuses conducted before 1926 are affected by undercount and age misreporting problems (Pool, 1973). Due to substantial under-reporting of vital events, the quality of Māori population estimates are considered less reliable until 1936, or perhaps even 1961 (Statistics New Zealand, 2004a).     
Our own estimates suggest serious under-reporting of deaths at older ages among the Māori and Non-Māori populations    
p8 3. Problems with Non-Māori old age mortality estimates before 1902. Prior to 1902, our estimated death rates at older ages are implausibly low

#### Australia ####


Australia under-5 populations by sex: census values, populations "as recorded" 1901-1961; 1966 & 1971 census allocated "unspecified" ages to ages based on responses to other questions, so the values ("adjusted" rather than pure census) should be fine for us.

1901 April 

Slightly different values are in ABD 3105.0.65.001 Table 2.1: "Population, age and sex, Australia, 30 June, 1901 onwards" (Released at 11.30am (Canberra time) 18 April 2019); downloaded 27 June 2021  from 3105.0.65.001 Australian Historical Population Statistics, 2019.

HMD has u5 counts and IMR date from 1921; we use ABS data instead (basically the same for 1921 onward)


##### IMR for AUS

IMR 1901-1991 from Australian Bureau of Statistics

For AUS  IMR 1870-1991 (1870-1901 AHS; 1901-1991 ABS; 1901 values same in both); Before 1870, we have only 1 point: NSW 1861 IMR & U5   (IMR 89.2 Ln(f/m) = -1.42% (m/f=101.4) )
 
1901 onward is straightfoward, with the data in [ABS spreadsheets](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/historical-population/latest-release) (3105.0.65.001 Australian Historical Population Statistics, 2019).     
U5 pops from [2. Population Age and Sex Structure](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/historical-population/2016/3105065001ds0002_2019.xls)
Table 2.1 has AUS u5 f/m pops 1901, 1911, 1921-2019.  Various other tables give state-level U5 by sex from 1901 onwards (NSW, Vic, Qld, SA, WA, Tas). Varying coverage of pre-1901 (see below.)     
IMR data from Table 5.4 in [5. Deaths](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/historical-population/2016/3105065001ds0005_2019.xls). This provides annual IMR, Australia and by states and territories (3105...ds0005_2019.xls) for 1901 forward.     

We may also want to use [4. Births](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/historical-population/2016/3105065001ds0004_2019.xls) in Table 4.1 Births registered by sex, states and territories, 1824 onwards  Births (m,f) for AUS and by state from 1860 or earlier.

For data before 1901, we mostly refer to Vamplew (1987) *Australians: Historical Statistics.*     
Ch 2 (Population) includes census data with u5 f/m pops for AUS and states for census years 1861 to 1901; also      
1854, 1857 Victoria; 1856 New South Wales (u4 populations). If additional regional data is needed, we should check the ABS Tables above (Population Age and Sex Structure) -- but I expect those are the same.

Ch 3 has IMR nationally and by states from 1870; also infant deaths. 1921 on has some sex-specific data.    
Ch 18 (Health & Medicine) has NSW death rates for u1 male and female for census years 1861 to 1891.


If narrower age breakdowns are desired, for state-level data 1911 onward, use [census publications 1901 onward](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/ViewContent?readform&view=ProductsbyCatalogue&Action=Expand&Num=2.2)   
For 1911, use census values "recorded" for regions; the "recorded" values for AUS are those in ABS 3105 Table 2.1  And so we don't use "unadjusted" (unknown ages added in, unsmoothed), nor the "adjusted" which are smoothed in some fashion. We rely on ABS 3105 Table 2.1 and our presumption that recorded is best. 

Notes on 1911 *Ages* "Number of Males recorded at each Age" and same for females, by state; also u5 f/m pops for 1901 and 1911. Also for AUS f/m pops by single-year of age in 1891, 1901, 1911 (p15); described as "unadjusted" but unspecified have been added in pro rata ("but the figures have not been smoothed" Table 7 p15pdf15).     
Also for AUS, f/m U5 pops for 1881, 1891, 1901, 1911.  1911 U5m 268,073  -- same note as above, uspec added in     
Also "adjusted number" at each age in 1911. Consider age 0:      
males recorded NSW 22,939 AUS 59,102 (Tab 1, p5)     But with unspec Tab 7 1911 AUS male u1 59,248    
adjusted males NSW 22,750 AUS 58,648 (Tab 9, p17)     
My older notes said: Decennial censuses benchmark 1881, 1891, 1901, 1911 are in [1911 census](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/2112.01911?OpenDocument) Ages volume has "adjusted" numbers by age/sex for 1881 1891 1901 1911  (pdf p32)  Vol1 discussion of smoothing has figures suggesting not much done to 0-4 group.

Aug30 looked to add 1926 and 1931, but copyright nonsense makes it impractical. IHS has IMR data -- so no need for a trip to NYPL for IMR data. 

** Yearbooks **

Maybe SR5 data for census years will be found in this set of the ["Official year book" at Hathi](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007119366), which has various years from 1924 to 1960. Or in [this set](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009064515) with various in the years 1917 to 1953.

Yearbooks 1919-61 are "Offsite" but requested/used at [NYPL](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/cb3033381#). That entry  explains "None published 1922, 1936, 1942-1945, 1947, 1951, 1958-1959. Some years combined."

The Bulletin of the WHO, [2000, 78:1175-1191](https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(10)1175.pdf)   
U% mortality rate ... has a number of advantages over the infant mortality rate as a composite measure of health risks
at young ages. In particular, the indirect demographic techniques for measuring the under-five mortality rate are more robust and less sensitive to assumptions about the underlying patterns of mortality than the infant mortality rate (28, 29) 
Data obtained from the complete registration of births and deaths provide the best possible basis for the direct estimation of child mortality. Unfortunately, such data are available for only 55–60 countries.d

Dempap uses full BRA. BRA data for IMR 1920, 1930 -- US totals (but 1920 is Jan 1, so 1920 refers to 1919; before 2021Nov 2, 1920 erroneously included some 1920 IMR). Ji also looked at US-North 1920 (excludes DC) amd   1930 US-North US-Sou-white US-Sou-black.        

USimrBRA.RDS is simply the BRA part of USimr-BRA.xls (which covers 1915-1931); that RDS file was made by EstUSimrDRA.R, and that file reads the u1 deaths counts from USimr-BRA.xls (top part of which is the BRA data) and merges them with the u1 pop counts in US1910SR1.RDS (which was created from 1910 PUMS full-count in 2nd part of buildPUMSurb10.R). That SR1 file has 27 states (tot/urb10k, rur10k)

Haines (1998:231) Unfortunately, collection of vital statistics was left to individual states and municipalities, which resulted in tardy and uneven coverage. Massachusetts was the first to begin this activity at the state level in 1842 and achieved relatively good coverage by about 1855 (Abbott, 1897:714-715). 

Abbott 1897:714 The period of forty years (1856–95) has been selected for consideration for the reason that it presents a definite portion of time in which the returns of vital statistics of the cities and towns may be deemed to be fairly accurate. The returns of the first few years following 1842 are more or less incomplete and untrustworthy, but those of the forty years under consideration must be considered as approximately correct.

<br> Note: arguably, the rural data are perhaps not "deemed to be fairly accurate" ?

Haines (2006 HSUS essay) The Massachusetts data reach reasonable quality by about 1860 and are reproduced here in Tables Ab928 and Ab1048–1058.

<br>In all these areas the mortality schedule was withdrawn from the enumerators. In all others they were directed to report deaths, and their returns ... compared with the reg records. The result of the comparisons, ... indicated that registration was defective in many places where it was supposed to be perfect, a considerable percentage of the deaths reported by the enumerators not being found in the reg record. As the enumerators did not report more than 50 or 60 per cent of the deaths, the presumption is strong that the omissions in the registration record were even greater than indicated.

### US Census for the Black SR1 ###
population volumes from 1850 and 1860 give U1, 1-u5, 5-u10 etc, for Whites, Free Colored Slaves.  Negro Population 1790-1915 Ch 4 provides SR1 for blacks 1850, 1860, 1870, 1900, 1910 and explains that 1880 and 1890 includes "indians, chinese, japanese" with blacks. So we need to extrapolate to fill in -- calculate non-white totals 

1940 can't find negro age 2 -- just nonwhite for single yr

Have nonwhite 1900-2010 ? really

## England, Scotland, Ireland Data & Results ##


### England, Scotland, Ireland ###

<p>
On SRB in England 1880, from [Plowden's Report on the census of India ... 1881](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/012155211)  (1883 p. 53)  <br>Plowden (India 1881) pdf  1623   In England they do not even publish in any detail the age figures as recorded, but doctor them, sometimes to the extent of 5 per cent., before using or printing them.*   * See Census Report of England and Wales, 1871, Vol. IV., p. 46, and XI
</p>

### Scotland

HMD offers age/sex data from 1855 -- probably their description of 1855-60 is relevant
"Population estimates for the period 1855-1860 are pre-censal population estimates calculated according to the HMD methodology (assuming zero net-migration)." 
    HMD sex-ratios are very close to census values (usually 0.1 less feminine than census; biggest discrepency is 1861's 0.3 less feminine).

HMD says The compulsory registration of births began on July 1st, 1837. However, according to the U.K. Office for National Statistics (ONS) birth registration was incomplete until 1874. Therefore, the quality of the data for 1855-1875 is assumed to be lower than in later years and should be used with caution.

Mitchell has IMR from 1855 

Scotland,  Births (1-year)	Last modified: 10 Jul 2020;  Methods Protocol: v6 (2017)
Scotland, Deaths (period 1x1), 	Last modified: 10 Jul 2020;  Methods Protocol: v6 (2017)
Use R to check the births/deaths ... 

Scotland 1851 is with England. 

SR5 values in HMD versus the census.  1861-1911 HMD a little less feminine.    
1861 HMD is 0.3 less feminine; 1871 is 0.1 less femin; 1881 is 0.2 less femin; 1891, 1901, 1911 are all 0.1 less femin.    

By either source, census or HMD, SR5-wise, 1901 & 1911 look less healthy (101.3-101.5) versus the 1861-1891 values (103.3    102.7   102.5  103.0) 

1861 the HMD u5 count is 0.5% above the census; HMD SR5 is 0.3 points less feminine. So the HMD SR5 looks healthier the census value. PUMS is full-count; it is 0.1 points less feminine thant the census (96.7 vs 96.8)

[Census of Scotland -- 1861](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008879851), Population Tables and Report.    [page xxii](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wix21p9xu99mi9m/Scotland1861xii.pdf?dl=0) has a great quotation about SBR 106 and the frail male "At birth 106 males appear for every 100 females ...; yet, by the law of nature, -- a law seen in still more powerful operation even in intra uterine life -- the tendency to succumb under disease is so much greater in the male than in the female, that by about the 18th year of life the proportion of the sexes becomes equalized, 100 males being alive at that age for every 100 females"       
Citation: Census of Scotland -- 1861, Population Tables and Report (Number of the inhabitants, families, children at school, houses, ... ), Edinburgh 1862.     
That volume does not have the age data.

Scotland 1861 [age table](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r8w9j9y521809yw/Scotland1861ages.png?dl=0). The text with the table says "the ages of only 2695 persons, consisting of 2467 men and 228 women, were not ascertained. The great majority ... consisted of seamen on board ... vessels ... round the coast." Table title includes "The Ages not ascertained distributed among the others." It is NOT the case that unspecified ages are simply distributed among all ages, in which case the m/f ratio of kids would be somewhat inflated: u5 SR would feminize by 0.2 points. Comparison of Table 1 to Ages table in Volume 2 shows u5 ages are not augmented, those e.g. 30-35 are.

[1861 at GoogleBooks](https://books.google.ca/books?id=ng8TAQAAMAAJ&dq=Scotland+1861+census+volumes&source=gbs_navlinks_s)  p xi says of Table 1 "the persons whose ages were not ascertained are distributed among the classified ages according to the periods of life to which they most probably belonged; "

1871 Census u5 count is 0.9% below the HMD value; the census SR5 is 0.1 more female than the HMD (97.40 vs 97.31).

p xiv Table 3 is a little inconsistent with the Table 1 values. Table 3 says U5 has 97.3 female per 100 males, and it lists u5 proportions as 50.656 and 49.344 but the Table 1 values give values 97.4 fems per 100 males, and 50.658 and 49.342 -- so Table 3 reflects some rough figuring (97.3 says less fems, 49.344 says more fems).  

Table 3 reports for 1871 England: 99.8 female to every 100 males.     

p xv "105.4 males are brought into the world in Scotland for every 100 females.  ... But whatever the case with other countries, it happens in Scotland that males are so much more difficult to rear than females, that by the time the 17th year of life is arrived at, the excess of males has died off, leaving but one male for every female."

"Original homelots were not divided up extensively until the 1840s, when enriched by the burgeoning whaling industry, New Londoners began to seek land for dwelling houses in outlying neighborhoods close to the center of town."
From Wikipedia The Official Illustrated Guide to South-Eastern and North and Mid-Kent Railways of June 1863, by George Measom, describes Lewisham as follows: 'Lewisham Station, situated on the slope of an eminence amidst picturesque scenery, beautiful green meadows rising abruptly to the summit of the hill on the left, dotted with handsome residences and gardens, while the Common is seen intersected by various cross roads and studded with country inns and houses on the low ground or valley to the right. The area of the parish is 5,789 acres... Lord of the manor, the Earl of Dartmouth to whom it gives the title Viscount'.

From 1881 census (Plowden p. 54)   
    the actual disproportion between the sexes, though it might exist to some extent, and to what extent it was impossible then to say, was not anything like so great as had hitherto been portrayed by the census statistics.
 ... the nearer we approach to accuracy in the Census of a general population, the more clearly does the fact appear that there is nothing peculiar in this country in the proportion of the sexes; that if there are from 104 to 106 females to every hundred males in Europe, this proportion also obtains in India, that is in all parts of the country where female infanticide is unknown. The truth is that the great bulk of enumerators have been singularly obtuse in comprehending the fact that the counting of females was a matter of any importance in census work. To understand how this is, we must take into account **the low estimation in which females are held in this country,** and also the reticence of the people on all matters connected with their female relatives. In the registration of births and deaths the same error obtains. **The birth or death of a female child is considered such an insignificant matter,** especially among the lower classes of the population, that a great number escape registration in certain districts; and, from the causes adverted, to the numbering of the female population in 1871 was undoubtedly erroneous in so far that many were omitted in the Census schedules. But in districts where the Census work was well done it will be found that the female population is invariably in excess of the male; in fact, the general accuracy of the results of any district may be judged of by the way in which the proportions of the sexes have been recorded."

p57 girls less-effected by the famine

p178  It is obvious that a wave of infecundity has during the last few years swept over at least Northern India, and that the five years between 1876 and 1881 have seen a far smaller number of births than took place between 1871 and 1875.

### various leads that we've glimpsed ###

[European Historical Population Samples Network](https://ehps-net.eu/databases) lists a wide range of micro data. Probably not useful for us. It includes the mosaic project, which seems like IPUMS for europe. [Historical Sample of the Netherlands](https://ehps-net.eu/databases/historical-sample-netherlands) indicates that Netherland used a population registry (rather than a census? or as well as?). I don't find any census-volume leads there.
