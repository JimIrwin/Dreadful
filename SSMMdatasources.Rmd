We'll use Mitchell's u5 populations for 1880 1890 1900 1910 1925 1933 (Series A2, 2013:13pdf3454, 1983:45). Seems Alsace & Lorraine included 1871-1918 (But Js assures these are small).  Series A1 Germany (pdf3408) has fn24 (pdf3437); A1 has pops for those census years. 1910 has fn25 From 1910 (2nd line) the territories ceded after the First World War are excluded 
A2 is pop by 5-yr ages.  (2013:15pdf3454);  1933n13 p45pdf3484 Excludes Saarland.
A1 is census pops (2013:10pdf3407) 1910 has two lines, n25 ()


Mitchell gives a consistent series for IMR data for 1875-1900 ("five states"), but 1900-40 (Empire & Republic) is different.    

Our spreadsheet (IMR-SR.xls) refers to 1875-1900 series as D5S (5 states) and it is to be used for SRs from 1880-1900.  The subsequent IMR series is DER (Empire & Republic) and it is to be used for the 1910 and later German data.

Mitchell reports (pdf139, 2013:pdf3577) IMR from 1836 (292), but via footnote 3 (pdf146p127) 1836-50 is Bavaria only; 1851-70 is Bavaria and Kingdom Saxony;  1871-74 + Baden, Wurttenburg; 1875-1900 + Prussia; 1901-1940 German Empire & Republic.   fn7 
1875 242 but n9 1875 without Prussia 308 (1872-1874 values listed are 301 307 297)  so Prussia pulls average IMR way down. Knodel 1974 corroborates that, with Prussia IMR 1871-75 224 1876-80 205


The u5 counts in Mitchell match the Yearbook Vol 4. There  "Eheschliessungen, Geburten und Sterbefälle in den Jahren 1872—1881" (Marriages, births, deaths).


HMD life-tables for Germany, [1870s](https://www.lifetable.de/data/DEU/DEUFRG018711880AU1.txt) has q0m of 252.73 q0f 217.40

E.g.

u5 for SR have 1880 1890 1900; looking for 1869 and 1910 and 1923    

From Google Doc:  we have data for IMR by sex for 1875-1907; total IMR (Mitchell/IHS) 1908 onward. M & F u5 pops for 1880, 1890, 1900 from contemporary sources; use Mitchell for 1910 u5 pops (total matches OK with 1910 census as reported in 1913 Statistische Monatschrift.  Austria’s stats bureau has u5 pops for only a very small subset, smaller than offered by the Jahrbooks of circa 1900/1910).  
HMD’s ”Austria” is very small compared to 19C Austrian sources. 
Yearbook 1886 p3. has 1880 u5 pops 1449168 1465661, matches IHS/Mitchell (2013:pdf3440) has 1449 1466. The corresponding SR-values are 98.87 and 98.84 (so IHS rounds to .1 lower).
Page 5 has infants deaths, m & f, <1month, 1-12mos. HMD says “In general, the degree of completeness is high enough to classify Austrian birth statistics as being of high quality”.
HMD’s birth count for 1880s are only about ⅕ of Austria’s YrBk for 1886. From MItchell/IHS it seems YrBk does not include Salzburg.

[Historisk statistikk](https://www.ssb.no/a/histstat/) Mitchell reports IMR for Norway from 1786; but I cannot find those in the sources he cites (too broad a set for me to get through and translate). We will use the HMD time frame, 1846 forward.

[Statistical Yearbook of Finland](https://www.doria.fi/handle/10024/67152/browse?type=dateissued) (Suomen tilastollinen vuosikirja).

***Australia***

1901 onward is straightfoward, with the data in [ABS spreadsheets](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/historical-population/latest-release) (3105.0.65.001 Australian Historical Population Statistics, 2019).     
U5 pops from [2. Population Age and Sex Structure](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/historical-population/2016/3105065001ds0002_2019.xls)
Table 2.1 has AUS u5 f/m pops 1901, 1911, 1921-2019.  Various other tables give state-level U5 by sex from 1901 onwards (NSW, Vic, Qld, SA, WA, Tas). Varying coverage of pre-1901 (see below.)     
IMR data from Table 5.4 in [5. Deaths](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/historical-population/2016/3105065001ds0005_2019.xls). This provides annual IMR, Australia and by states and territories (3105...ds0005_2019.xls) for 1901 forward.     

We may also want to use [4. Births](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/historical-population/2016/3105065001ds0004_2019.xls) in Table 4.1 Births registered by sex, states and territories, 1824 onwards  Births (m,f) for AUS and by state from 1860 or earlier.


For data before 1901, we mostly refer to Vamplew (1987) Australians - Historical Statistics.     
Ch 2 (Population) includes census data with u5 f/m pops for AUS and states for census years 1861 to 1901; also      
1854, 1857 Victoria; 1856 New South Wales (u4 populations). If additional regional data is needed, we should check the ABS Tables above (Population Age and Sex Structure) -- but I expect those are the same.

Ch 3 has IMR nationally and by states from 1870; also infant deaths. 1921 on has some sex-specific data.    
Ch 18 (Health & Medicine) has NSW death rates for u1 male and female for census years 1861 to 1891.


If narrower age breakdowns are desired, for state-level data 1911 onward, use [census publications 1901 onward](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/ViewContent?readform&view=ProductsbyCatalogue&Action=Expand&Num=2.2)   
For 1911, use census values "recorded" for regions; the "recorded" values for AUS are those in ABS 3105 Table 2.1  And so we don't use "unadjusted" (unknown ages added in, unsmoothed), nor the "adjusted" which are smoothed in some fashion. We rely on ABS 3105 Table 2.1 and our presumption that recorded is best.

The Bulletin of the WHO, [2000, 78:1175-1191](https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(10)1175.pdf)   
U% mortality rate ... has a number of advantages over the infant mortality rate as a composite measure of health risks
at young ages. In particular, the indirect demographic techniques for measuring the under-five mortality rate are more robust and less sensitive to assumptions about the underlying patterns of mortality than the infant mortality rate (28, 29) 
Data obtained from the complete registration of births and deaths provide the best possible basis for the direct estimation of child mortality. Unfortunately, such data are available for only 55–60 countries.d

p xiv The registration record was accepted as sufficiently complete and satisfactory in Mass, CT, RI, and NH; certain counties in the state of NY ... cities: Albany, Cohoes, NY (greater), ... and certain counties and cities in the state of NJ ...
<br>In all these areas the mortality schedule was withdrawn from the enumerators. In all others they were directed to report deaths, and their returns ... compared with the reg records. The result of the comparisons, ... indicated that registration was defective in many places where it was supposed to be perfect, a considerable percentage of the deaths reported by the enumerators not being found in the reg record. As the enumerators did not report more than 50 or 60 per cent of the deaths, the presumption is strong that the omissions in the registration record were even greater than indicated.

A 1950 black SR02 of 101.0 results from applying the same correction to the nonwhite SR02 from the spredsheet for 1950 in the National Intercensal Tables: 1900-1990 (released in 2004). </p>

### US Census for the Black SR1 ###
population volumes from 1850 and 1860 give U1, 1-u5, 5-u10 etc, for Whites, Free Colored Slaves.  Negro Population 1790-1915 Ch 4 provides SR1 for blacks 1850, 1860, 1870, 1900, 1910 and explains that 1880 and 1890 includes "indians, chinese, japanese" with blacks. So we need to extrapolate to fill in -- calculate non-white totals 

1940 can't find negro age 2 -- just nonwhite for single yr

Have nonwhite 1900-2010 ? really

## England, Scotland, Ireland Data & Results ##


### England, Scotland, Ireland ###

<p>
On SRB in England 1880, from [Plowden's Report on the census of India ... 1881](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/012155211)  (1883 p. 53)  <br>Plowden (India 1881) pdf  1623   In England they do not even publish in any detail the age figures as recorded, but doctor them, sometimes to the extent of 5 per cent., before using or printing them.*   * See Census Report of England and Wales, 1871, Vol. IV., p. 46, and XI
</p>

### Scotland

HMD offers age/sex data from 1855 -- probably their description of 1855-60 is relevant
"Population estimates for the period 1855-1860 are pre-censal population estimates calculated according to the HMD methodology (assuming zero net-migration)." 
    HMD sex-ratios are very close to census values (usually 0.1 less feminine than census; biggest discrepency is 1861's 0.3 less feminine).

HMD says The compulsory registration of births began on July 1st, 1837. However, according to the U.K. Office for National Statistics (ONS) birth registration was incomplete until 1874. Therefore, the quality of the data for 1855-1875 is assumed to be lower than in later years and should be used with caution.

Mitchell has IMR from 1855

Scotland 1851 is with England. 

SR5 values in HMD versus the census.  1861-1911 HMD a little less feminine.    
1861 HMD is 0.3 less feminine; 1871 is 0.1 less femin; 1881 is 0.2 less femin; 1891, 1901, 1911 are all 0.1 less femin.    

By either source, census or HMD, SR5-wise, 1901 & 1911 look less healthy (101.3-101.5) versus the 1861-1891 values (103.3    102.7   102.5  103.0) 

1861 the HMD u5 count is 0.5% above the census; HMD SR5 is 0.3 points less feminine. So the HMD SR5 looks healthier the census value. PUMS is full-count; it is 0.1 points less feminine thant the census (96.7 vs 96.8)

[Census of Scotland -- 1861](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008879851), Population Tables and Report.    [page xxii](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wix21p9xu99mi9m/Scotland1861xii.pdf?dl=0) has a great quotation about SBR 106 and the frail male "At birth 106 males appear for every 100 females ...; yet, by the law of nature, -- a law seen in still more powerful operation even in intra uterine life -- the tendency to succumb under disease is so much greater in the male than in the female, that by about the 18th year of life the proportion of the sexes becomes equalized, 100 males being alive at that age for every 100 females"       
Citation: Census of Scotland -- 1861, Population Tables and Report (Number of the inhabitants, families, children at school, houses, ... ), Edinburgh 1862.     
That volume does not have the age data.

Scotland 1861 [age table](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r8w9j9y521809yw/Scotland1861ages.png?dl=0). The text with the table says "the ages of only 2695 persons, consisting of 2467 men and 228 women, were not ascertained. The great majority ... consisted of seamen on board ... vessels ... round the coast." Table title includes "The Ages not ascertained distributed among the others." It is NOT the case that unspecified ages are simply distributed among all ages, in which case the m/f ratio of kids would be somewhat inflated: u5 SR would feminize by 0.2 points. Comparison of Table 1 to Ages table in Volume 2 shows u5 ages are not augmented, those e.g. 30-35 are.

[1861 at GoogleBooks](https://books.google.ca/books?id=ng8TAQAAMAAJ&dq=Scotland+1861+census+volumes&source=gbs_navlinks_s)  p xi says of Table 1 "the persons whose ages were not ascertained are distributed among the classified ages according to the periods of life to which they most probably belonged; "

1871 Census u5 count is 0.9% below the HMD value; the census SR5 is 0.1 more female than the HMD (97.40 vs 97.31).     

Ages Census of Scotland, 1871, Eighth decennial census of the population of Scotland taken 3d April 1871, with report. Vol. II.    BPP 1873 LXXIII [C.841]    xii     
p xiv Table 3 is a little inconsistent with the Table 1 values. Table 3 says U5 has 97.3 female per 100 males, and it lists u5 proportions as 50.656 and 49.344 but the Table 1 values give values 97.4 fems per 100 males, and 50.658 and 49.342 -- so Table 3 reflects some rough figuring (97.3 says less fems, 49.344 says more fems).  

Table 3 reports for 1871 England: 99.8 female to every 100 males.     

p xv "105.4 males are brought into the world in Scotland for every 100 females.  ... But whatever the case with other countries, it happens in Scotland that males are so much more difficult to rear than females, that by the time the 17th year of life is arrived at, the excess of males has died off, leaving but one male for every female."

1901 ages are given in 1911 vol II (along with 1911 ages). The census is 0.1 more feminine than the HMD.

1901 Census vol III is occupations (see GoogleBooks)

London 1841 is given with and without Lewisham and Hempstead -- probably more rural-like, but too small to matter
"Original homelots were not divided up extensively until the 1840s, when enriched by the burgeoning whaling industry, New Londoners began to seek land for dwelling houses in outlying neighborhoods close to the center of town."
From Wikipedia The Official Illustrated Guide to South-Eastern and North and Mid-Kent Railways of June 1863, by George Measom, describes Lewisham as follows: 'Lewisham Station, situated on the slope of an eminence amidst picturesque scenery, beautiful green meadows rising abruptly to the summit of the hill on the left, dotted with handsome residences and gardens, while the Common is seen intersected by various cross roads and studded with country inns and houses on the low ground or valley to the right. The area of the parish is 5,789 acres... Lord of the manor, the Earl of Dartmouth to whom it gives the title Viscount'.

     some other cause is at work to produce so great a numerical inequality of the sexes: and the info so widely collected in late years, together with the fact that females are more numerous among Mahomedans than Hindoos, and among low castes than high castes, have forced Mr.Plowden (p3) to the conclusion that the disparity is mainly due to the wide prevalence of the practice of female infanticide, including in that workd not merely active deprivation of life but also neglect and disregard in the rearing of girls.

From 1881 census (Plowden p. 54)   
    the actual disproportion between the sexes, though it might exist to some extent, and to what extent it was impossible then to say, was not anything like so great as had hitherto been portrayed by the census statistics.
 ... the nearer we approach to accuracy in the Census of a general population, the more clearly does the fact appear that there is nothing peculiar in this country in the proportion of the sexes; that if there are from 104 to 106 females to every hundred males in Europe, this proportion also obtains in India, that is in all parts of the country where female infanticide is unknown. The truth is that the great bulk of enumerators have been singularly obtuse in comprehending the fact that the counting of females was a matter of any importance in census work. To understand how this is, we must take into account **the low estimation in which females are held in this country,** and also the reticence of the people on all matters connected with their female relatives. In the registration of births and deaths the same error obtains. **The birth or death of a female child is considered such an insignificant matter,** especially among the lower classes of the population, that a great number escape registration in certain districts; and, from the causes adverted, to the numbering of the female population in 1871 was undoubtedly erroneous in so far that many were omitted in the Census schedules. But in districts where the Census work was well done it will be found that the female population is invariably in excess of the male; in fact, the general accuracy of the results of any district may be judged of by the way in which the proportions of the sexes have been recorded."

p57 girls less-effected by the famine

p178  It is obvious that a wave of infecundity has during the last few years swept over at least Northern India, and that the five years between 1876 and 1881 have seen a far smaller number of births than took place between 1871 and 1875.
