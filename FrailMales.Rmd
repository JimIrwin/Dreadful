Frail males are familiar to students of biology (less so, to economists and historians). A wide range of research ^[(bio? medical? social science?)] demonstrates that tough times during pregnancy skews the sex ratio in live births, and that tough times in infancy skews the infant sex ratio. (Healthy population: 1.053 boys per girl at birth, then some levelling as frail males die more, countered by maternal mortality for a while, until older age claims the frail male sooner, resulting in low sex ratios among older adults).

In the 1970s, research on slavery in the antebellum South pointed to a population whose material conditions of life were consistent with three facts: hard work, a growing population, and political stability (until the Civil War. Conditions  with 
- slaves working hard and producing lots of output  and 
- reproducing like white population. 
- political stability (cf Haitia; Nat Turner, Denmark Vesey)      until?  ...   union troops nearby ...  AGENCY


1. economists (Fogel and Engerman and later)  show that southern slaves  produced a lot (debate on how/why), 
eliminates old discussions that view plantations as chaotic and violent prison with starving inmates. Lots of work, fueled by lots of food.   

2. historians (Blassingham and Genovese) show that slaves were people, not passive victims.   Agency / Space 
eliminates discussions of how masters  "treated" the slaves.  Explore how slaves carved out space for their own families and communities. Debate over +/- incentives ...  debate on how much slaves able to transcend ...

3. ecos and hist remind of contrasts to sugar areas (WI and Brazil) ...worse demog; LR poorer ... 

_____________________________________________
Almost a consensus ... with one key exception: Steckel's view of slave life "A Dreadful Childhood" (1986 and later).
Steckel says slave infants and children had "a dreadful childhood," as bad as the worst urban slums of India or Brazil.
Evidence from Ships's manifests, slaves being transported by sea from old South to New Orleans, are measured to identify them in order to enforce the ban on US participation in the Atlantic slave trade (since 1807). In the manifests records,
Steckel finds evidence of tiny children, and infers low birthweight, and high mortality as infants and kids. Mothers overworked; children underfed (Steckel says). Material conditions as bad as worst urban slums of India or Brazil.

So Steckel presents US slaves as a  "peculiar" population: tiny kids, tall adults, via "catch-up" growth. A different perspective on slave life: awful conditions for kids, then lots of food when working. So perhaps the enslaved were powerless to protect their children? Ouch.
But maybe ... scrunching ?   theory & evidence:  breastfeeding ?  theory & evidence: how powerless were slaves ?   

Richard Steckel's picture of a dreadful pregnancy and childhood in the AB South points to the proposition that slave births would have been skewed toward females. We can test this by comparing sex ratio among the young in slave and free populations in the AB South.
So Steckel's picture of slave pregnancy in the AB South points to the proposition that slave births would have been skewed toward females. We can test this by comparing sex ratio among the young in slave and free populations in the AB Sotuh.


To advance Steckel's view, we pose the null hypothesis that the southern slave population's SR1 is the same as the white population's, against the alternative that the slave SR1 is lower. Point estimate is -9.5% 

To refute Steckel's view, we pose the null hypothesis that the slave SR1 is at least 5% points below the white SR1, against the alternative that the slave SR1 is closer to the white value.


### Bio-social mechanisms and evidence ###


#### Fetal Mortality ####
Relative to females, the frail males are culled in utero by maternal stress and malnutrition. With stillbirth rates on the order of 13% (like early 20th C black populations), the natural SR of 1.05 will be pulled down  

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("DrixlerSRstillbirths.jpg")
```  

Take Drixler evidence : SR in SB of 1.3 or more, and rates of SB relative to living, to see 1.053 pulled down to 1.026^[That 1.026 will then be pulled down further by infant mortality which is borne more by the frail male, probably 1.2x as much. So if after the stillbirth culling we have a SR of 1.026, a 30% infant mortality rate will leave infant sex ratio of 0.95. The 1.026 comes from a SR in stillbirths (SB) of say 1.30, which implies male SBR  1.234 times the female, with a 12% rate of SB (low for the dreadful maternity scenario)].

Potentially relevant to stillbirth effects, Sweden 1999-2000 infant mortality among preemies (born at 23-24 weeks) was 55% for males and 32% for females. That in [Ingemarsson] (https://jimirwin.github.io/Dreadful/lit.html#Ingemarsson), who also cites Hassold et al for 1.32 sex ratio in chromosonally normal spontaneous abortions.

Hui-Lung et Al. ([1997 Obstetrics & Gynecology (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0029784496003754)] say "Disparity in the crude fetal death rates for blacks and whites is explained almost entirely by differences in birth weight distribution." (1979: blacks 14.6 **per thousand**, whites 8.2 )

Steckel 1986 EEH  p186 wartime famine in Holland reduced birth weight 300g   energy supplements during last two trimesters rural Guatemla increased birth weight 120g   chronic poor nutrition not a general problem among working slaves     short maternal stature [not] an important factor [in slaves' low birth weight]   birth weights of whites exceed blacks in US by ~200g

Alabama 1860 census   thinking about how to clarify counting of infants    
Covington Co 8 m  18f  I count 8 18 fractional ages ... use PUMS for 1 yo?
Wow, state-level infant sex ratios for slaves ~95%  white >1.05
  
### A Priori Anti-Steckel

Were slave newborns small enough for the Steckel mortality effect? McIntire, Bloom Et Al birth-weight neonatal mortality risk is at weights below 3rd percentile .03% vs .3% in Dallas TX hospitals in the 1980s https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/html_charts/wtageinf.htm 
 
 percentile    male    female 
------------   ------ ---------
  3rd          2355g    2414g  
  10th          2774     2747   
 50th           3530     3399              
------------   ------ ---------

Planters would have noticed that feeding kids was worthwhile Stulp & Barrett (2014)  Indeed, lack of nutrition, particularly protein deficiency, is recognized as one of the main contributors to reduced infant growth in developing countries, and supplementary food programs have been shown to produce clear improvements in growth rates and reduced stunting Edozien, Khan & Waslien, 1976; Beaton & Ghassemi, 1982; Silventoinen, 2003
