20200512 would be nice to corroborate maternal misery with the SSR of a known population with horrible material conditions
Ji: modern mumbai? or Rio (to which Steckel refers)
Js: antebellum NE slums are a separate fish to fry

census of india 1891 p64 maybe something? --  mention female survive famine more  p247 ratio for <1
https://dsal.uchicago.edu/statistics/1876_excel/index.html 1881 India census

Frail males are familiar. A wide range of research demonstrates that tough times during pregnancy skews the sex ratio in live births. So Steckel's picture of slave pregnancy in the AB South points to the proposition that slave births would have been skewed toward females. We can test this by comparing sex ratio among the young in slave and free populations in the AB Sotuh.


#### Bio-social mechanisms and evidence ####


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("DrixlerSRstillbirths.jpg")
```  
Take Drixler evidence : SR in SB of 1.3 or more, and rates of SB relative to living, to see 1.05 pulled down to 1.02
SR in stillbirths (SB) maybe 1.30, implies male SBR  1.23 times the female, with a 15% rate of SB (but plausibly low for the dreadful maternity scenario)

Hui-Lung et Al. (1997) say "Disparity in the crude fetal death rates for blacks and whites is explained almost entirely by differences in birth weight distribution." (1979: **blacks 14.6** per thousand, whites 8.2 )  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0029784496003754











? The famous famine in WWII Holland -- Steck: Stein et al

Steckel 1986 EEH  p186 wartime famine in Holland reduced birth weight 300g   energy supplements during last two trimesters rural Guatemla increased birth weight 120g   chronic poor nutrition not a general problem among working slaves     short maternal stature [not] an important factor [in slaves' low birth weight]   birth weights of whites exceed blacks in US by ~200g

Alabama 1860 census   thinking about how to clarify counting of infants    
Covington Co 8 m  18f  I count 8 18 fractional ages ... use PUMS for 1 yo?
Wow, state-level infant sex ratios for slaves ~95%  white >1.05
  
### A Priori Anti-Steckel

Were slave newborns small enough for the Steckel mortality effect? McIntire, Bloom Et Al birth-weight neonatal mortality risk is at weights below 3rd percentile .03% vs .3% in Dallas TX hospitals in the 1980s https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/html_charts/wtageinf.htm 
 
 percentile    male    female

Planters would have noticed that feeding kids was worthwhile Stulp & Barrett (2014)  Indeed, lack of nutrition, particularly protein deficiency, is recognized as one of the main contributors to reduced infant growth in developing countries, and supplementary food programs have been shown to produce clear improvements in growth rates and reduced stunting Edozien, Khan & Waslien, 1976; Beaton & Ghassemi, 1982; Silventoinen, 2003
