<h2>Vineyards</h2>

<h3>Orcia DOC</h3>
<p> Small and promising is <a href="https://www.aziendapoggiogrande.it/?lang=en" target="_blank">Poggio Grande</a>. Father-daughter team; maybe biodynamic? certainly boutique and beautiful; attractive via Google reviews.
Ji's anticpated highlight is  <a href "https://www.aziendapoggiogrande.it/orcia-sangiovese-riserva-di-testa-mia/?lang=en"  target="_blank">ORCIA SANGIOVESE RISERVA DI TESTA MIA</a>


<p>Poggio wines are mentioned in the handy tasting info from <a href="https://www.chiaragiorleo.com/en/2019/12/06/the-most-beautiful-wine-of-the-world/" target="_blank"> Chiara Giorleo</a>. Jim wants to try “di Testa mia” Orcia Sangiovese Riserva 2015 by Poggio Grande A very young company. The wine is complex with hints of cedarwood and fresh herbs that refresh a layer of kirsch, chocolate and walnut. Consistent on the palate, full but still balanced by a good acidity. Toasty aftertaste.<p>

<h2>Restaurants</h2>
<h3>Evening Dining</h3>
In San Quirico, <a href="https://osteriavaldorcia.com/index.html" target="_blank">L'Osteria</a> for Tapas and a great wine list (Ji: cosy & homey, I think). Google reviews mention people turned away by curt staff? and maybe no pasta?
