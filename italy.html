<h2>Vineyards</h2>

<h3>Orcia DOC</h3>
<p> Small and promising is <a href="https://www.aziendapoggiogrande.it/?lang=en" target="_blank">Poggio Grande</a>. Father-daughter team; maybe biodynamic? certainly boutique and beautiful; attractive via Google reviews.
Ji's anticpated highlight is  <a href "https://www.aziendapoggiogrande.it/orcia-sangiovese-riserva-di-testa-mia/?lang=en"  target="_blank">ORCIA SANGIOVESE RISERVA DI TESTA MIA</a>
<br>Poggio wines are mentioned in the handy tasting info from <a href="https://www.chiaragiorleo.com/en/2019/12/06/the-most-beautiful-wine-of-the-world/" target="_blank"> Chiara Giorleo</a>. Jim wants to try “di Testa mia” Orcia Sangiovese Riserva 2015 by Poggio Grande A very young company. The wine is complex with hints of cedarwood and fresh herbs that refresh a layer of kirsch, chocolate and walnut. Consistent on the palate, full but still balanced by a good acidity. Toasty aftertaste.</p>
<p>Also promising, if not as cute, is <a href="https://www.valdorciaterresenesi.com/" target="_blank">Valdorcia valdorciaterresenesi</a></p>
<h3>Brunello di Montalcino</h3>
<p>Perhaps more corporate/commercial is <a href="https://bacciwines.it/estates-renieri/">Renieri di Montalcino</a>
</p>
<h3>Montepulciano</h3>
<p>A quick listing to explore: <a href="https://icario.it/?lang=en">Icario</a>, with 20 hectares of vines, <a href="http://www.poderetanagatta.it/">Tanagatta</a>, family-run 5 hectares plus olive groves; <a href="https://www.canneto.com/en/vinery/">canneto</a>, perhaps too big and corporate/commercial?
</p>
<h2>Restaurants</h2>
<h3>Evening Dining</h3>
In San Quirico, <a href="https://osteriavaldorcia.com/index.html" target="_blank">L'Osteria</a> for Tapas and a great wine list (Ji: cosy & homey, I think). Google reviews mention people turned away by curt staff? and maybe no pasta?
