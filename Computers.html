<h2>Chromebooks</h2>
<p>Staples has a <a href="https://www.staples.ca/collections/chromebooks-93">wide selection of chromebooks</a> (useful for identifying options). Similarly, Amazon.ca has a wide selection.<br>
The usual 11.6" screen, with 4GB RAM and a 32GB ssd-drive, is available for $300 (Acer)
<br>$353 Acer C732 "ruggedized" Intel Celeron N3350 (16Q3)

<h2>PC (windows) Notebooks</h2>
<p>Standard notebooks with Windows 10 seem to run at $600 or more (but some older ones show up for $500 or more). Staples offers more in this price range; Amazon seems to be $700-$900.
<p>
Maybe can get big hard-drive in a $500 laptop. Such as Lenovo Idea Pad 3 at <a href="https://www.staples.ca/products/2974874-en-lenovo-ideapad-3-81w1001hcf-156-inch-notebook-26-ghz-amd-athlon-3150u-1-tb-hdd-8-gb-ddr4-windows-10-home#product_description">Staples</a> One concern: just old-style USB 2.0?
</p>

<h2>Apple = Expensive</h2>
<p>Low-end Apple is the MacBook Air, which <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca_edu_93120/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air">starts at $1169</a> (educational pricing, $1299 regular) </p>
