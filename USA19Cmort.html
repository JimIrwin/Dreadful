<br>p1 Mortality rates fell by 40% from 1900 to 1940 ... Together with the late 19th C, no other documented period in American history witnessed such rapidly falling mortality rates.  ...   coincided with the disappearance of the "urban penalty" -- the higher mortality rates observed on urban areas throughout the [p2] 19th C.
<br>p3 "decennial census statistics clearly show that the striking mortality declines began before the turn of the century. The crude death rate during the 1850s ... 22 per 1,000 (Meeker 1972). This rate had fallen to about 18 by 1900 and decline to about 11 by 1940" citing US Census Bureau 1941; US Census Office 1902.
<br>p4 A substantial mortality “penalty” to living in urban places therefore developed as American cities grew during the 19C (Haines 2001), n5: Historical data limitations make it difficult to pinpoint when this mortality penalty first emerged. Szreter and Mooney (1998) provided evidence that an urban mortality penalty was evident in Great Britain as early as 1830. <i>Jim: maybe they mean Table 6, showing LE in provincial cities pop>100,000 1830s 29 Eng&W 41</i>

<p>Haines (2001 Annals Demog) p35 Concerning the death rates for young children (aged 1-4) the ratios were much higher, with urban mortality being 94% higher in 1890 and 100% higher in 1900. For infants the excess urban mortality was 88% in 1890 and 48% in 1900.    ... The rural urban differential seems to have been true earlier as well. For seven New York counties in 1865, the probability of dying before reaching age five was .229 in urban areas but .192 in rural locations (Haines, 1977).

Before 1837 in Great Britain and before 1900 in the United States information on death rates [p444] is so sparse that historical demographers are at odds not only on the levels of mortality but even on the direction of change (Vinovskis 1972; Easterlin1977; Lindert1983).

		Although it is widely known that, during the 19th century, life expectancy was substantially lower in cities than in rural areas, ... differences ... survival rates and proportional hazard ratios across urban sizes and rural environments are less well understood.1 <br>
				n1 For example, Weber (1899) JIM? reported life expectancy at birth in the cities of Massachusetts was almost seven years less than that in the state as a whole.

	<br> There is a well-developed literature on urban versus rural mortality rates. Vinokskis, correcting the earlier work of Jaff and Lourie, found that, in Massachusetts towns with an 1830 population of 10,000 or more, life expectancy at ages 10–14 was 46.7 years. In towns with less than 1000 inhabitants, it was 52.5 years ... <br>
