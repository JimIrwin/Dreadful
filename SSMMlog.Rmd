### current log ###

2022.0527   1911 to 1971 we don't have consistent boundaries -- so be careful of how we extraploate on 1911 SR for IMR, don't overstate the geographic similarities ...

**BOUNDARY CHANGES TO KERALA **

found India 1971 census age/sex   -- entered Kerala, but let's add Brerar and some urbans  -- don't want our SR story always to be same (6% swing implies ...)  





2022.0526 wondering how to use  u1deaths data of 1910, 1900, 1890, 1880 ... 
 1900 census Vol III vouches for registrations in Mass, CT, RI, NH ...





2022.0523
REGION 22  urb10 too small mostly.  34MO ok 56k   

2022.0522 noticed MD urb10 was set to use=0  -- a mistake, I believe.

2022.0516  
1930 11 DE 5k, 52 MD 29k       43 FL 35k  
1930   63 ID 21k, 64 MT 19k,  68 WY 9k /  65 NV 3k, 66 NM 22k, 67 UT 20k

2022.0515 
imBRA has building blocks for cea prediction, need to combine with sr5, after packing
BigCities  1920 NY Chi Philly   1930 bigCities add  Detroit u5w > 140K   
leaving LosAngeles out for now (78+15=93K), because no racial breakdown; can add via use race=all (VS & pums are fine, it is cenVol problem)
not  Cleveland u5w < 65K not StLouis u5white = 52k   -- longer term aggregate for midW-city group.

LA 78K but 17 "other races"   -- recall Mexican classed as nonwhite -- for first pass, drop 
CA  AZ   

2022.0514 # RDS/u5CEAtots.RDS has US/urb-rur/4regions fPUMS 1850-80, 1900-40; cenVol 1940-50, and some earlier.
 
 OH 1920 Cleveland u5 88433 black 2371 or 3%   -- but mort is not avail by race ... so drop from u5cea: for 1920 OH we'll have rur10 and urb10 --  will need to knock out urb10 for state-year where we have urb106?


for CEA get a prediction equatiom BRA data (1930, 1920: metro/urb106/rur10)

2022.0513  fPUMS does not split Brooklyn out from New York NY  -- probably could do it via publlished census ... POSTCEA

2022.0512   use fPUMS for splitting up states (might get those breakdowns, with effort, from published census volumes)
Use URBPOP<100 (100 00 is 10K and URBPOP seems best at including unincorporated NewEngland towns of size -- no difference for VT, ME, NH, CT; same effect for NJ & PA, NY no diff (PA urb10 764.3 vs 760.7; NJ 364.35 vs 360.9)

2022.0430  concern with title saying "indicator" of IMR -- reveal was more accurate ..  Using Childhood S R to characterize IMR 

2022.0422 need to settle on intro (Jim wants point that IMR is much lower now than historically, with our method a hist tool ... )  

2022.0421 leads for Paris 1950s data

2022.0418 Ji about done with intro section; finishing up expansion of "not structural" discussion -- now it is too long; need to find balance (but clear simple statments here make model more useful and make results easier to interpret later)

Ji wants to block out the interp of results ... 


Eventual set of regs for robustness:   direct: CSR on IMR; reverse: IMR on CSR  -- how predict IMR? via reverse, or solve out direct? 
also CSR on IMR with slope-dummy when IMR gets to a level where Drevenst shows MU has fallen to 0.17; CSR on IMR 2 slope dummies -- IMR low & high (viz mu values)
also CSR on IMR IMR2
also CSR on IMR and dummy variables based on SRB values ...



2022.0416  play around with examples of u1pop and either u1d or B to estimate IMR  -- separation factors are more influential for IMR(B,P) then IMR(D,P)  -- intuitively sensible, since D/B is the magnitude of interest and it is <<1, so loading uncertainty into the numerator rather than the denominator, generates more uncertainty.  


wonder if Somalia's u5 mortality rates by sex are consistent with SR data?

2022.0415 notice South Africa yearbook 1980-81 they "estimate" black IMR to be 100-110; values are given for Whites 21.6 Coloureds 132.6 and Asians 36.4    -- do we have CSR?

2022.0414  Demography's top journal dismissed our work; instead of sending to the least prestigous Demography journal, why not send to a high-quality econ outlet like AER or JPE?

send to Hill ?  Kenneth Hill is a demographer who specializes in deriving estimates of mortality from incomplete or deficient data.  He has a Ph.D. from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and has spent most of his career at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Harvard School of Public Health. Kenneth_hill_1@yahoo.com

noted CSR offers powerful test of M-I misery -- to reject a null hypothesis of wellness in favor of alternative of misery. But CSR is not a powerful test of M-I wellness, can't reject null of misery without evidence that there is not mortal miscogyny. 


2022.0413  Jim identifies 12 valid CSR values for Sweden 1757-1855, to add to current 1860 onward ....

2022.0411 

concerned that maybe DemRes has low-quality articles, tidying up tidbits of knowledge. What about Pop Studies or Pop Dev Rev ?
Ask Rodrigo who reads what ?

Population Studies: A Journal of Demography
For over half a century, Population Studies has reported significant advances in methods of demographic analysis, conceptual and mathematical theories of demographic dynamics and behaviour, and the use of these theories and methods to extend scientific knowledge and to inform policy and practice.

The Journal’s coverage of this field is comprehensive: applications in developed and developing countries; historical and contemporary studies; quantitative and qualitative studies; analytical essays and reviews. The subjects of papers range from classical concerns, such as the determinants and consequences of population change, to such topics as family demography and evolutionary and genetic influences on demographic behaviour. Often the Journal’s papers have had the effect of extending the boundaries of its field.



Population and Development Review seeks to advance knowledge of the relationships between population and social, economic, and environmental change and provides a forum for discussion of related issues of public policy. Population and Development Review is published quarterly.
The journal contains: Articles on advances in theory and application, policy analysis, sociographic studies, and critical assessments of recent research  Notes and commentaries on current population questions and policy developments  Data and perspectives on new statistics and their interpretation

2022.0405 data entry for 1890 complete; xls file has building blocks for SR5:IMR or SR5:u1d   --- endless task to idealize groupings. Hoping 40K is a large enough population; could drop smaller places, or
then RURAL:
RI 13.6 can be added to Mass 43.5  or to CT 39 or to LongIsl-ish 37.6   (adjacent to all; might share LongIsl maritime/close to city)
NH 20.9 can be added to Mass 43.5 or to VT 27.
NYG3 27.4 (just above NYC) can be added to CT 39 or to NYG5 113k (albany etc)
NYG2 28.5 (above Alb) can be added to VT 27 or NYGr5

add NH 21k & VT 27k ; either drop RI 13.6k or add to CT 39.2K or to LongIsle 37.6 ; NY gr3 is above NYC and has 27k -- it can be added to central NY's  113k  or to CT; NY group 2 is above Albany and pairs easilty with VT
2022.0404

for "cautious" use bigger minimum aggregates -- VT+NH  RI+CT  and NYGrp3+ (LongIsl etc) 


could look at NY rural total populations, in order to peel off tiny cities (<25K)  ...
ill want to leave California out of any serious 1890 estimation

2022.0403 finished entering the 1890 mortality data -- ended with 18 mostly large (100k) observations; but realize that the 1890 is standalone because of age-question anomoly. Thinking we should disaggregate, maybe have building blocks of (say) 10k to 30k and then think of how to assemble,  But we do want an *a priori* take on what size of population is enough to keep errors-in-variables manageable size ... ...

2022.0402 hope 1890 volumes give us rur/urb pop splits ...

2022.0401
  Jim to clarify -- from data on heights & weights --- to get a predictor of height from weight -- reg or reverse?

stumbled onto 1880 volume 11, 12 which have deaths data. v11 states 15-29; cities 499-56; v12 441-473 has cities & race     
v11 499-56 has groups of cities -- check if they are deemed reliable data; if so, use!

looking at England, for life tables of 19th C (high IMR) to compare to 1921 or so (lower IMR) -- to show that it's been there for anyone who thought to look p23 excess male IMR 1841-1920

Ji suggests we consider an aggressive response to Demography – send out DemPap to 10 high-profile demographers, asking for their input in relation to Hayward’s suggestion that we need to explain why no one else came up with our idea of using CSRs as an indicator of maternal-infant misery and a proxy for IMR.

2022.0330 progress on 1915-19 

1915-19 should have 15 good-sized observations with full imr data ... 
Cities + larger places: 15
Metrops + larger places:  15
# NEXT n=15 : NYCxB Brkln Phila MassUrb CTurb othNEurb othNYurb othPAurb MIurb MNurb PArur NYrur MIrur MNrur NewEngRur  


12 (4 cities, 4 state-urban, 4 state-rural) + otherNewEngRur + othNewEngUrb + midWestUrban(ex-Detroit)
 not sure about Boston (too small?) and Pittsburgh (too small -- maybe break out other western PA cities? maybe group with Buffalo?)

have for sure 12 large places: NYCexBrkl, Brooklyn, Phila, Detroit, urbanMass(ex-Boston), urbanNY(ex-NYC), urbanPA(exPhil,Pittsb), urbanCT, ruralPA, rurNY, rurMI, rurMN.  (Rural PA could split up to add up to 3 obs)
Maybe Boston big enough, with u5white pop of 69K ; or fold it into MassUrban?
Certainly pool non-Mass NewEngland rural and nonMass,nonCT NewEngland urbam
Probably pool MnnStP with MnnUrb and MIurbanNonDetroit (13.7K+3.9K+16.8K)   
   Not sure what to do with DC (small).



CA is not a big part of our story, so useful to use for thinking about pooling to reduce binomial varation in CSR that will create attentuation bias in estimating the effect of q on CSR ... CA has 84k births in 1930, 49K are urban, 

NY  brooklyn 1930 214k

so with u5=100k, 1 std dev is 0.158% or less than 0.16%  ... our modelling says effect of q on lnCSR is mu*q where mu is excess male morality (relative to female). If we have mu=0.20 (small), then 0.16% change is caused by an IMR change of 0.8%-point or 8 per thousand (such as 100 to 92).  In our US panel, we are playing with IMRs in the range of 50 to 120, but most of the data are in the 50 to 90 range? 

Can we go with 60k as the threshold -- 1 std is then 0.204% (like an 11-point IMR change?). Maybe we can try it with different minimum sizes?


2022.0329 look at random variation in SR5 (as binomial) in relation to the sort of variation that life-tables predict -- say we have IMRs of 60  90  120   then what are the predicted values of SR5?   The we pick a minimum SR5 value so that teh random variation in SR is (say) only 10% as large as the systematic variation ...   with n=100k 1 std dev is .158%  which would push the SR5 0.67 towards female?


wondering how to decide whether to combine LA & SanFran -- *a priori* if both small, then combine. 1930's u5 populations LA 79K  SanFr 32K   -- maybe the answer is to set a higher limit, like pop of 1 mill?



2022.0328  for 1915-19 clean set of eIMR (5yr avg) for 25 places (rur/urb/metrop by state)  -- may want to collapse (aggregate) the smallest two ... thousand Births are 5.8 11.1 20.1 23.4 24.2 27.0 31.8  ... (5 yrs of that should give 4.5x those) ... probably

noon: Finished data entry for US states (urb, rural, some big cities) for 1925-30 and 1915-20 and 1905-10. Turning now to R scripts to create various RDS files with IMR u1d 

2022.0327 noting that black SB seem high -- maybe also SRB fem-tilted?
  looking for Brooklyn 1925-28  -- have u1deaths but not births; so can break out Brooklyn for u1d/SR5 but not for IMR

2022.0326  regress SR on IMR and on infDeath/u5pop -- which one wins?

2022.0324 compiling rural/urban by state 1915-1920 and 1925-30; Next will do 1905-1910  and 1896-1900

2022.0321  127-      
2020.0320  Consider using deaths per U5 pop instead of the IMR -- if we think births data are wrong ...     
CA 1930 can infer white/nonwhite -- but maybe treat it like AZ and go with "all" not with "white"?      
Blanks to fill in for births:  AL 1925, 1926     

2020.0319 for white urb/rur IMR by state, BSBRA T1 1917 1919   but what about 1920?  Tab II has urb/rur all
    
2022.0318  rural white births by state is BSBRA, maybe MS has u1 deaths rural?  -- nope, not 1916
2022.0316 
 RI ?
added 1930 LA Al
wondering if we can get DRA info not in BRA data?    GET LA cities at least 1918 ... etc  And can extend BRA using DRA if missing just a year or two 
Fill in LA 1926 via deaths -- best guess 1926 births same as 1927, so avgIMR 60.4 (w/o 1926 60.7)
LA u1 deaths 1926 from MS -- if births = min for 1927-30 eIMR 61.8 if avg 61.4  if max (1927 value), 60.4;  105% seems large annual swing, so look at that 1927*1.05 eIMR 59.8   1927/1.05  61.05 
AL  59.8 to 60.9 via 5% births swing ... use 1927 get 60.3  (w/o 1926 60.9)  ALl about same





2022.0314 for 1906-1910 IMR (infant deaths), 1906-09 offers only cities > 100K, which I have entered (or just mostly?)

2022.0314 thinking to get avg InfDeath for large pops of DRA, such as Chicago ... 1910 deaths are 3.8% above the 1906-10 mean;
MS1909 does not give totals for urb/rur in DRA states. It gives 1906-1909 u1 white deaths by sex, and 1906 is 104% of 1909; assuming 2% pop growth, the 1906 IMR would be 113% of 1909 -- still similar in context of our precision. So we can focus on geographic dimensions?

2022.0311
 right now SRcenDRA has URB10500 and URB500P -- the latter includes places like Cleveland and Pittsburgh ... probably want those to be added to URB10500 ... maybe just make the cutoff 
  via CITYPOP .. Chi 21852 NYC 47668 Phil 15490    -- cutoff at 15000
 
 separates urban(over 500K) from urban(10k to 500k)  

metros are Brooklyn 180K,  NYCexBrk 320K, Philly 147K, Chicago 223K ... then we drop down to Boston 63K, Clevel 62K, StLouis 58K, Pittsburgh 56K,   Baltimore 46K


1910 geography -- NYC pop breaks into Brooklyn (KingsCo 470) NYCo (Manh&Bronx 610) Queens (tiny 810)  StatenIls (tiny 850 Richmond Co); infant-deaths (IDth) are available by borough.  Ji splits NYC into Brooklyn (CITYj=4611) and rest-of-NYC (CITYj=4614) CITY=4610
 
categories rur10 rural (pop<10k) urb105 (pops 10k-500k) urb500p (cities over 1/2 )
 
Cleveland deaths not avail by race -- hope that the smaller metros are non-informative (relative to Reg cities generally), so we can simply dump Cleveland into OHIO registration cities. Otherwise, do rural-white urb10-50 all Cleve alll ..... 
 
 
2022.0310 Ji assembling 1910 data:  e.g  Mass into 3 parts: rural, Boston, NonBostonUrban
 MS1910 says rural has cities <10,000     But census1910 adopts 2,500 or more   ... so I would need to pull data for places of 2.5-10K   Distribution by broad age periods of the population in places having from 10,000 to 25,000 inhabitants: 1910 . . . . • . . . . . . . 489

USA u5 pops decennially 1940-1970 from 1980 census. HMD data is weird to describe/cite -- no need!
-- even the "input" data is highly manipulated ... We just need 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970 ... 1980 is good.

Spain -- use HMD DATA not HMD raw -- that stuff is crap.  And use HMD-data for IMR, start IMR 1930 because of false-stillbirth issue (corrections made 1930 onward). Or drop Spain for missing girls?

Issue of leave-one-out approach -- see [Predictive inference with the jackknife+](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/jackknife.pdf)
p487 1.1. Background. The idea of resampling or subsampling from the available data, in order to assess the accuracy of our parameter estimates or predictions, has a rich history in
the statistics literature. Early works developing the jackknife and bootstrap methods include
Quenouille [18], Quenouille [19], Tukey [26], Miller [15], Efron [8], Stine [23]. Several papers from this period include leave-one-out methods for assessing or calibrating predictive
accuracy, similar to the predictive interval constructed in (1.2) above, for example, Stone
[24], Geisser [10], Butler and Rothman [4], generally using the term “cross-validation” to
refer to this approach. (In this work, we will instead use the term “jackknife” to refer to the
leave-one-out style of prediction methods, as is common in the modern literature.) Efron and
Gong [9] provides an overview of the early literature on these types of method

Ji working on fn on when sex-differences in IM first recognized -- seems to be Clarke (1786), but Théré & Rohrbasser (2006 Hi Fam) give credit to Stuyck and    [Struyck p187](Stuyck1740p187.png) is about stillbirths, I think -- Jesse to confirm.

Also - T&R claim Moheau recognized IM-SR -- Jesse please check [p207](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc1.cu56263562&view=page&seq=229&skin=2021) and following 3-4 pages.  [p216](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc1.cu56263562&view=page&seq=238&skin=2021) might show m f IMRs of 1/4 and 1/5?


2022.0210 Arduous journey to discover that Graunt doesn't have infant or child mortality (infers births from christenings). Instead Clarke 1786 is earliest Ji has found. Lit page is a mess, so search for Clarke to find relevant section ... 


In our SSMLit Ji tended to combine SRB and SR-IM (sex ratio of IM), so care needed. Thus Arbuthnot has SRB male skewed, but not IMR male skewed; and Grech historical overview is about SRB.  
  
Do we need to cite Pongou for interaction of environ with SRB and excess male IM?

2022.0209 Ji rewrote abstract


2022.0208 made comments on PDF of draft two. Big step toward the submission, but (1) some substantive issues to address and (2) needs some streamlining of the presentation/argument.     

1. substantive: reverse regression? acknowledge SRB. More generally: are we offering a prediction algorithm? Or are we saying: dude, because of female infant mortality advantage -- frail baby males --  IM pushes SR towards girls; the higher the IM the more female the SR. Or at least that is what happens in the absence of mortal misogyny -- in the absence of sex-disrimination that erases the biological survival advantage of little girls; in other words, when we are not studying a population with "missing" girls and women. When it's not a missing girls population, we expect a simply strong pattern with female-bias of SR correlated with the IMR. And when we have SR:IMR data we FIND that simple strong relationship. And that WILL BE a basis for making inferences about IMRs. Here, in a RN, we simply document the relationship, and illustrate how it could be used to infer. Illustrate with Black and white in South Africa in 1911. Vital Stats for whites, not blacks. WHite 1911 90. Via SRBs and SRs --  strong and plausible result that 1911 South Africa IMRS of whites and blacks 90 and 330. Strong evidence of maternal-infant misery for B not W -- but not the place to make claims of precise magnitudes of IMR --- just > 30% .... 



BTW OUr result casts doubt on SouAfr stats for 1991  coloured IMR of 40? ln(f/m) ~0 





SRB? ... underlying model of deterministic factors: ln(M/F) = ln(SRB) + ln(f(IMR)) where     
 ln(SRB) = ln(106) - ln(g(maternal misery))   and IMR=h(maternal-infant misery)   .... 
 
 And regress IMR on ln(SRB)  constant term contains SRB info????


early rough thought: finding paper structure unsatisfying -- can't we simply rip through our argument, using footnotes to equivocate and elaborate as needed --- that mean's no intro beyond saying that for knowledge of historical population health and welfare, IMR is important and too little known. But we introduce a way to substantially expand our konwledge ....

re 1870 fPUMS so far pretty general PUMS less male (for MA NY NJ PA)

2022.0206Ji 

I look at county level SR in Mass --1 large county PUMS count seems fine (no evidence of PUMS undercounting male)



Punjab -- as well as below, see our [Sources & Lit page](https://jimirwin.github.io/Dreadful/SSMLit.html) and search "Missing" (I think ... )

-- British census reports from 1865 to before 1911 generally downplay infanticide, and pay a lot of attention to possibility of underenumeration of girls (connected to "low esteem" of females), and to possible male-biased SRB from natural causes (e.g. wide age gap of spouses), while alluding to differential care and girls less valued.

1911 census report on Punjab by a Sikh ((Pandit -- his title) Hari Kishan Kaul) has best statement for us, perhaps: "But if female infanticide does not prevail to any noticeable extent, the neglect of female infants has been the general rule" .  Our drafts folder has his 2-page discussion of nature of neglect of little girls ...



Plowden's report on 1881 Census "Whether or no female infanticide prevails in the Punjáb to any considerable extent, and I believe it does not, there can be no doubt whatever that the female is less welcome and less cared for than the male infant."  Note that Plowden gives a lot of credence to possibility of underenumeration of female girls and youth, even as he remarks on the low regard in which they were held; he certainly downplays infanticide.

vol III Appendix D, p. lxi
That infanticide is practised at all generally I do not believe ... But there is not the slightest doubt that the life of a girl is less valued and worse cared for than that of a boy, chiefly indeed among the anoterogainous clans who cannot find husbands for them, and the higher castes of the eastern Punjáb who will not sell their daughters, and among the Hindoos who spend much money on their marriage and account it is shameful to leave them unmarried; but also in a less degree and as a relic of the old fighting days, and perhaps from the contagion of Hindoo ideas, among all other classes of the Punjáb people without distinction of race, religion, or locality.




2022.0204      

1870 Massachussetts -- PUMS age 0 SR 1.7% less male than cenvol. 


US-white SR5 pubCen vs PUMS:  1850 PUMS 0.4% more male (3.7), 1910 PUMS 0.4% less male -- all others are within 0.1%.     
The "white" SR is of dubious meaning, because for the South, the lower 40% of the SES is excluded. I'm inclined to use 4 cells, North/South/White/NonWhite ... but 1850 & 1860 North's nonwhite is too small for our method. Probably look at All and at white ...

In PUMS -- regions of 1850-70 are NorE  NE MA 11 12; MW 21 22
South: 31 32 33    West 41 42  NorE 11 12   22 21  NOT 91

HMD Norway credible IMR runs from 1876 < feb4 correction of: both IMR & SR run from 1846, so maybe no option to extrap Sweden's IMR:SR. But do we think the HMD IMR is credible? >

2022.0202 be sure to allude to shift to sex-selective abortion as mechanism male-biased sex-ratio -- probably should qualify that we look to period before ultrasound opens up sex-selective abortion -- so we are looking at infanticide or fatal? neglect 

jottings: blight vs blemish; just as we got the ability to measure it, infant mortality largely faded ...      
Possible applications for dempap: US in 1840-1860  white black;  sweden -- early IMR estimates OK? ;

2022.0201 late-night wrap up. Ignore research note vs paper issue until we've written our piece. Then if it is short enough, it's a research note.  In any case, Demog's structure makes it sensible to leave the introduction until after we've written the bulk of it.

para2 -- start with Scottish census and excess male-infant mortality?    
1861 quote. An excess males at birth has long been well-known to demographers. More recently, the fact of excess males has figured importantly in efforts to count missing women. Excess male-infant mortality also figures in estimating missing women, and the Scottish census 1861 was surely not first recognition of hte fact. But the potential importance of excess male mortality has largely been overlooked. It turns out to provide a basis for estimating infant mortality in the absence of vital statistics.

south africa history *Starving on a Full Stomach*    ... No one computed the national rates of infant and adult mortality, fertility, nuptiality, or causes of death for black South Africans; nor are there statistics for height indicating whether the black population has been stunted.

 For 1911, a little concerned for sex-biased age-heaping in S Afr, with SR01 8.3%, SR04 7.4%, SR59 -1.2%, SR1014 -8%, SR1519 -0.2%
Consider these Bantu SR values: u2 8.3% u5 7.4% 5-9 -1.2% ; but, sr4 4.8% (i.e. age 4 is least female of the u5 ages) and age-heaping into 5 would make age 4 the most female. So maybe age 5 not the problem. But the fluctuations across age-groups concern me ... 

Jesse offers 
     
    FN   Marco-Gracia and Fourie (2021) argue that the female-skewed sex ratios of black South Africans reflect preference for girls. However, as shown in Figure 5, female-skewed sex ratios are not, in it of themselves, evidence of and gender preference. Such ratios are, instead, evidence of high infant mortality and poor maternal health. We take the female-skewed sex ratios to be indicative of the misery of black South Africans during the colonial period.

Jim revises to:

         ... our model predicts... per 1000. More generally, the extreme tilt toward girls in the/that Bantu child sex ratio points to an extreme case of maternal and infant misery. FN Marco-Gracia and Fourie (2021) argue that the female-skewed sex ratios of black South Africans reflect gender discrimination against young boys; however, we view miserable living conditions as a much more plausible explanation.


2022.0129 Dempap needs revision in South African discussion --     
(1) replace indigenous with Black     
(2) feature our lead ...
As an illustration of the potential of sex ratios to reveal population health, consider the blacks in South Africa under the British Empire, for whom we have no direct evidence on infant mortality. In 1911 South Africa, there were 7% more girls than boys under the age of five recorded in the “Bantu” population. With some 12% more girls than expected in a healthy population, our model predicts an infant mortality rate in excess of 350 deaths per 1000 births.16 Mention SRB issue? More generally, the extreme tilt toward girls in that Bantu child sex ratio points to an extreme case of maternal and infant misery.FN  X and FOURIE (2021 EcHDev) argue that Black South African sex ratios reflect gender discrimination against young boys; however, we view miserable living conditions as a much more plausible explantion,

en allowing for a two-point difference in the sex ratio at birth between white and black populations,16 our model predicts an infant mortality of 350–400 deaths per 1000 births.17 At the same time, the white population of South Africa enjoyed one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, around 90, and, accordingly, a sex ratio of 3% more boys than girls

missing boys -- is their a simple table to point out their folly?

south africa     
from Dempap: As an illustration of the potential of sex ratios to reveal population health, consider the indigenous population of South Africa under the British Empire, for whom we have no direct evidence on infant mortality. In 1911 South Africa, there were 7% more girls than boys under the age of five recorded 7 in the “Bantu” population.15 Even allowing for a two-point difference in the sex ratio at birth between white and black populations,16 our model predicts an infant mortality of 350–400 deaths per 1000 births.17 At the same time, the white population of South Africa enjoyed one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, around 90, and, accordingly, a sex ratio of 3% more boys than girls      
    Hmmm -- [indigenous](#SAindig)South Africans? 
    More generally, that passage -- at least in isolation -- seems to bury our lead; our lead being that the extreme female-tilt of the SR5 of the "Bantu" is evidence of a horrific level of infant mortality (and also the finer point, that +7% girls is outside the domain of our IMR:SR regressions)

Maybe [IPACC](https://www.ipacc.org.za/southern-africa/) has current terminology, "indigenous" referring to the San and Khoekhoe, as distinct from Black south africans (who would include Bantu-speaking, among who are the [Zulu](https://minorityrights.org/minorities/zulus/) -- described as an "ethnic group" (among SA Blacks, I suppose)).

Eriksson et al (2018 Demog) -- ENT -- revise 1915-1940 IMR estimates of HSUS downward; from their figures, revised white IMR 1915 looks like 82 or so, down from about 100. They say the revisions are only via adjusted birth-counts, but I suspect they imply huge revisions in the u1 population. As I see the role of separation-factor values, they can't make a huge difference to the U1 death rate ....     

re:ENT revising 20th C US IMR, I wonder if infant death rate and IMR were way out of whack? That might explain how ENT can make such as big change to IMR (I'm thinking simply of the mechanics)     
Wsapp to Js: with 1/q = 1/m + (1-a), and with US-DRA-white 1920 m = 10%, the possible range of q is (9.1% to 10%). ENT (2018 Demog) suggest an adjusted IMR for 1920 that is maybe 4/5 of the HSUS value. To me that suggests that their work implies an upward revision in the u1 population of the DRA; offhand, I guess that U1 population will get scaled up in proportion to their scaling up of births. hmmm ... again the undercount literature is influential ...

Roughly, having worked on about 50 people, 



</p><p>2022.0125 sent Jesse a draft of my email to G Alter. Issue is: keep or drop undercount page & worksheet

</p><p>2022.0119 Trying to move past Hacker (2013 SSH). Accepting his 1900 undercounts, 1900 SR5 is 103.1, which is almost as male as we see in 1860-1880 ...  So Hacker's 1900 result offers a challenge to our claim that 1900 was worse. Note that I dismiss his 1850-80 estimates because of the use of the PUMS 1% samples (where the SRs are nuts to us).
</p><p>But our 10-year forward evidence offers a strong corroboration of our sex-ratio time-path ...
</p><p>A key issue is that he presents 1.036 as the 1900 SR5 for his reconstructed US-born white population (p90), but given his underenumeration rates, that implies a census SR5 value of 1.0316 or 1.032 -- but census has 1.026?  So where is he getting an extra 0.6?
<br>Table 1 (p88) reports the "net undercount" of U5 native-born whites in 1900 as 6.8% males and 6.4% females.  Applying those rates to published census data (from 1900 of 1970) gives SR5 103.1 (a 0.45 %-point move toward males), a full 0.5% points below Hacker's reported value. The full-count PUMS white SR5 is less male, 102.5, and it only gets to 102.9 using Hacker's undercounts. 
<br> For native-whites in 1900, Coale & Zelnick offer underenumeration rates of 7.6% male, 6.5% female -- for a 1.2%-point  SR-move toward male. Their male & female rates for 1880 the same (9.1%), so a C-Z correction would reverse our results.
<br> For northern-born whites, U5 "net undercounts" are 5.5% males and 3.8% females; for southern-born 5.7% & 5.0%  -- how is it that the national undercount rates are so much above the sectional rates? It can happen because he uses the PUMS samples for all census years.
</p><p>2022.0118 next: look for 1940? (seen today) which had 1900-1940 5yr age groups -- and see what Hacker's adjustment gives for a sex-ratio?
<br>tackling Hacker (2013) -- key issue now is that his corrected 1900 native-white SR5 is 1.036 while the PUMS has 1.026
 -- what do we make of that 1% point shift toward male? His corrected 1880 is 1.042 (so only a tiny bit healthier than 1900
<br>What do we make of his 1900 adjustment? His Table 1 reports m 6.8% f 6.4%  -- applying that would move SR5 0.44 toward male, not 1% ???
</p><p>2022.0117 hoped today to send email to GAlter.<br>
1) include plots of SR2 and SR5, each with 10-year forward sex ratio counterparts; also 2-3 and 12-13 (as he suggested). Email comment that the 10-year forward comparison suggest no role for female undercounting in generating our results. ISSUE: if age-heaping at 5 yr-olds, do we want 5&under sex ratios also?
2) undercounting more generally. what do we want to say here -- beyond the point that undercounting in general is not our concern, and that our work on IMR has implications for estimates of undercounts (and since we argue for lower IMR than conventional, we imply less undercounting than current estimates?)

<br> 1930 cen 103.5/P?  NatWhite, says Hacker, 104.5 ;   PUMS 103.5 adj 104.4
</p><p>The 1930 white SR5 can range from 103.5 (cen940) to 104.5 (Hacker's nat white value) to 104.8 (via Hacker undercount %). Interesting to note the 1930 volume put Mexican into other races, but 1940 places them in white; and the 1940 way gives 1930's white SR5 about 0.5 less male.

<br>The 19th-century sex-ratio values look about the same whether we use the current-year census values or the corresponding 10-year-forward values. Perhaps the most interesting result here is that 1850 stands out with the most "male" sex ratios observed, with the sex ratios among older children in the 1860 census corroborating the results for the under-twos and under-five's in the 1850 census.

(the differences across years are much more pronounced -- )


<br>0-4 vs 10-14 (or 9-14) No sign of undercounting of girls in the 19th-century: forward ratios are more male (1850, 1870) or about the same (1860) as the current-year ratios. Note that the 20th-century forward ratios are consistently more female, so if we used the future-based values as indicators of sex ratios, it would strengthen our finding of healthier infants in the 19th C than at the turn of the 20th C.  
<br> 0-2 10-12

1900 & 1910 show up as more female than the 19th C (future-based ratio as)


<br>Not seen for under-two (ages 0-1) or under-five sex ratios. 
1) For the 19th century, the current-year sex-ratio values and their 10-year forward counterparts are very similar. The 1850 and 1870 current-year sex ratios are somewhat less male than their ten-year forward counterparts, which would suggest relative undercounting of boys. The 1860 current-year sex ratios are just a little more male than their forward counterparts, but all the 1860 sex-ratio values are much more male than those of the 1900 or 1910 (for example, the smallest gap is that between 1860's forward 10-14 sex ratio (3.1% more boys) and 1900's current 0-4 sex ratio (2.5% more boys). A STUPID COMPARISON, BECAUSE THE 1900 VALUES WE WHICH WE DEEM RELIABLE HAVE FORWARD values that are at least 1/2 %-point more female ... 

DETAILS: the 10-year forward 10-11 and 9-11 sex-ratio values are very close. FN: the strongest hint of female-undercount is in 1860, when the future sex-ratio values (10-11 & 9-11) are 0.2% more female than than the current. More generally, looking at the plots, the 10-year forward sex ratios 

Cases with apparent undercounting of boys: 12-13 vs 2-3, all 3 years; 10-11 vs 0-1, 1850 & 1870; 
10-year forward ratios more male: 12-13 vs 2-3 
10-year ratios about the same : 9-11 vs 0-1
<br>
The forward sex-ratio values for the 19th-century results corroborate our results. 
<br>19th-C U5
</p><p>blah blah ...
<br>For 1850 and 1870, the 10-year-forward sex ratios among ages 10-14 are distinctly more male than their current-year counterparts (ages 0-4); for 1860 the values are almost the same. For the censuses of 1900 to 1930, the forward ratios among age 10-14 are consistently more female than their current year counterparts; for example. the 1900 forward ratio is 2.
<br>1) Comparing the sex-ratio values of the current 0-4 year-olds and the future 10-14 year-olds corroborates our findings. The forward-sex ratio values exhibit a stonger pattern of 19th-century sex-ratios being more male than those of 1900 or 1910. FN Same result if we use forward 9-14 sex-ratio values; that worth noting because the 19th-century census data exhibit male-biased age-heaping at age 10. <br>
2) Comparing current 2-3 & forward 12-13 sex-ratio values also corroborate our findings, much like the 0-4 & 10-14 values (which include the 2-3 and 12-13 data). Note the current-year age 2-3 sex ratios exhibit a weak version of the pattern we stress -- <br>
3) Comparing the current 0-2 & the forward 12-13 sex-ratio values also corroborate our findings, much like the 0-4 & 10-14 values (which include the 2-3 and 12-13 data).<br>


##### Detailed discussion #####

Current 0-4 and 10-year forward 10-14.
Compared to the current 0-4 sex-ratios, the forward values for 1850-1870 are more male than the current in 1850 and 1870, just 0.1% less male in 1860. The 20th-century forward (10-14) values are distinctly less male the current (0-4) values.

<br> if we took 20th C as accurate, see that forward 10-15 sex ratio tilts a little less male than the current 0-4 sex ratio; for example, for 1900 we 2.5% more boys than girls among the 0-4 year-olds and 2% more boys than girls among 1910's 10-14 year-olds. More generally, the forward sex-ratio points lie consistently above the current points. For the 19th C, scholars suspect underenumeration among those 0-4 years old; if take the forward 10-14 sex ratios as correct, and apply the 20th C pattern, then we'd place the 19th-century 0-4 sex-ratio points below the forward values, about the same in 1860
<br>Forward ratios for ages 9-14, are a little more supportive (1860 a little future more male).

<br> Let's consider using 1890 US census for cross-sectional comparisons, within the US.

<p>2022.0112 for Alter response -- avoid getting into undercount weeds, because issue is relative undercount could bias sex-ratio values. For example, need to avoid Hacker's undercount revision efforts.
<p>2022.0111 working on responding to George Alter (notes are on Ji's computer). Thinking 2 parts -- response to under-count concerns and sending of dempap.
</p>
<p>Ji looking at 10yr forward sex ratios (SR) of ages 9-11 and 9-14 in comparison to current SR for under-two and under-five. All 4 measures tell similar stories. To Jim's eye, the results are consistent with somewhat more noise in the 1850-1880 results compared to those for 1900-1930; but the noise is minor. Dwelling on results does not give Jim any insight except that the rough measures (national in a period of rapid geographic change and westward shift of population) tend to support our findings/argument; more importantly, they do not offer evidence against our findings/argument. The 1900 and 1910 SR values are distinctly more female than those for 1850-1880; interestingly, the 1900-census data suggests that the deterioration in maternal-infant was underway in 1890.
<p>Switching from the current-census SR values to the future-based SR values would result in a greater relative female tilt in 1900 and 1910. The smallest observed effect is with fut9to14, with SR values of -3.23% in 1860 and -2.10% in 1900 -- a 1.13 %-point move toward female. Across those years, the SR5 value moved only 0.76 %-points toward female. And from 1870 to 1900 the SR moved only 0.54 %-points toward female while the fut9to14 value moved 1.31 %-points toward female.   
</p>
<p>Notably, where the future-based SR values deviate from their current counterparts, they tend to tilt toward male. This modest effect is most evident for 1870 SR measures: the fut9to14 SR value is 0.4 points more male than the SR5 and the fut9to11 SR value is 0.1 point more male.  
<br>Generally, with an eye toward concerns that we might have spuriously healthy-looking SR values for the 19th C, the current SR5 values are the least healthy-looking (relatively female-tilted), and the future-based SR values point to better health (somewhat more male).
</p><p>Perhaps the key anomalous results are the 1860 and 1870 SRs of fut9to14 -- 1860 is odd as the SR5 and fut9to14 SR values are about the same, while the fut9to14 values in 1850 and 1870 are more male than their SR5 counterparts; and 1870's fut9to14 value is odd for exhibiting a modest tilt toward male while the other 3 measures tilt female to varying degrees. 1870 exhibits the most female sex ratios, as only the fut9-14 is not at a most-female peak,
<br>One general feature is that 1900 onward, both the future-based measures are somewhat more female than both of the current measures. This is not the case in the 1850-1880 period. Perhaps the female-tilt of the future measures reflects reliable enumeration, with some excess male mortality for ages over 5 years. In contrast, the 1850-1880 period sees the SR5 as the most female with the SR2 tending to be least female; the future measures lie between, with 9to14 more female then 9to11, as expected. Might we interpret that as reflecting under-enumeration of infant girls more than infant boYS? If so, the future 9to11 SR should be much more female than the SR2 -- and it is not. The future 9to11 is about the same as the SR2.
<br>



future-based measures just a little more female than the SR2 and less so than the SR5. Under-counting of infants is presumed to be the problem; our age-heaping analysis of NY state points to male-biased heaping toward one-year of age, but might suggest that u5 enumeration is solid. SR5 being more female than SR2 makes sense, as the yet-to-die male infants have more effect in SR2 than in SR5. 
<br>1900 forward the SR2-SR5 gap is smaller. In periods of rapid decline of IMR, the SR5 reaches back more to include more higher-mortality children and thus dampen the SR2 SR5 gap.
<br>1940 to 1950 sees SR5 improve a little and SR2 worsen a little.

If we assume age enumeration is more accurate from 1900 onward, and that 1850-1880 SR5 is more accurate than SR2, the implication is that U2 under-enumeration was biased toward omitting girls (so SR2 values appear overly healthy),  


This is reassuring, insomuch as female-biased

The strict or proper IMR estimates are based on counts of IMR as follows:  1920 nI2=2 1930 nI2=3  and 1920 nI5=6 and nI2=3 ; the nI variables give the counts of IMR in the IMR5 or IMR2 estimates so we can exclude the non-strict IMR estimates.

Recall (1124) we looked at implications of IMR differences for fertility ... roughly consider IMRs of 25% vs 10% and thus exact-age-1 survivals of 75% vs 90% of births. With the same post-infancy mortality, the implication for birth rates is that the same stable population would need only 75/90 as many births, -18% as many (ln[75/90]).
If we use GRR for our fertility measure, Wrigley reports values for France vs England as 2.00 and 2.93 (-38%) in 1800-09 and 1.70 and 2.34 or 32% for 1850-59 ...

<br>Fussing with Hacker (2013 SSH) for his estimates of underenumeration. For 1850-1870, these rely on the PUMS samples, which are just 1% and show much different SR values than the full-count PUMS or the published census. I would think we ignore the PUMS-sample-based enumeration estimates. But for 1880 forward, he uses published census data, along with DRA-based life-tables, so maybe those estimates are worth paying attention to -- that is, the 1880 forward values (although the 1890 age-glitch might derail?). </p>
<p>Using his underenumeration estimates, 1900's full-PUMS SR5 moves up from 102,5 ti 102.9 ; and the published census SR5 of 103.2 moves up to 103.6 -- so in both cases, a 0.4 move toward male. So the adjustment suggests a somewhat healthier population. And adjusted 1900 (102.9) looks about the same as 1870?
<br>But do we dismiss the Hacker estimates because they rely on life-tables? ANd what do we make of the discrepancies between fullPUMS and published census?
</p><p>More important: perhaps our regional results are robust to these sorts of adjustments? JIM WILL CHECK!!
</p>
Hacker (2013 SSH) estimate of census undercounts by age-group. E.g. for 1850, he has u5 males as 15.2% undercount -- so census/true=0.848 and he has u5 fems as 15.4% undercount. Oddly, his reconstructed SR5 for 1850 (Table 2, p90) is 1.027 and via his undercounts that implies the census SR5 would 102.9 -- and that is the PUMS sample value. Our value of 103.8 is from the fullPUMS; the published census volume data yields SR5 103.3 for whites, which includes foreign-born. The corresponding fullPUMS value (all whites) is 103.7 -- so the fullPUMS is about 0.4 above the published value.

<p>2021.1116
<br>for Alter issues, we need to stick with native-born white for 1860 to 1870 (like demog  work, b/c of emancipation ...). And we need to clarify: what are the populations we discuss in CEA? USA or North?
<br>  pums57 1860-80 all (need W only for 1860 to 1870); pums56 1850-60 all;  pums55 1920&1930 BW  ; pums54 1910&1920 BW; pums53 1910&1920 0-16 BW only; 


1976 HSUS cites VS Special Report Vol 45 No 1 for IMR. That source also has 1-4 mortality, by sex, 1900-1950. There we see (p22) the impact of the 1918 flu -- CMR 15.7 1916 to 1920 11.1 10.7 15.7 9.3 9.9  -- so a 50% jump. In contrast, the IMR bumps <10% ...  1916 to 1920 has 101 94 101 87 86. Maternal mortality also spikes (HSUS B145 1917-66 1918-92 )

Probably useful to use fPUMS to sketch out extent to which 0-yr-olds are enumerated in 1850, 1860, 1870, 1880, vs 1900 (best year, age-wise). This with an eye toward SR2-5 as a preferred indicator of IMR?

Linder & Grove (VSUS 1940 p576) offer IMR 1915-1940 for the Registration States of 1915 (excluding RI -- I figure because of early 1920s NAs). 
<br>1915-18 ~100,  1919-20 ~89, 1921-23 ~79, 1924-25 ~73, 1927-30 ~63, 1933-34 ~53, 1935-36 ~49, 1938-40 ~42 
<br>Notice the USA IMR 1935-36 ~56, 1938-40 ~49    In other words, as of late 1930s, the original DRA has somewhat lower IMR (about 7 points, or >14% with IMR in the 40-50 range). But the 1915 group and full RA are about the same in 1925.
<br>Notice we now include 1925-1932, with IMR falling from ~72 to ~58. At that time Mass. IMR 73 53   NY 68  53.

Making the point that indexing-enumeration of race and nativity is error-ridden because of coding errors when interpreting manuscript. For example, [17 people](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7b9huqofxvnwimu/BlackIrishKingsCo1860.jpeg?dl=0) error-enumerated as Blacks in Brooklyn in 1860. Wondering how to find examples of mistaken nativity coding?

<p>2021.1111 leads to pursue:
Work the sequence Hacker (2003 Demog), Haines (1989 Demog), Coale & Zelnick, Thompson & Whelpton (1958) for (1) underenumeration of infants -- implications for our CEA findings and (2) the use of the Mass life tables for predicting birth rates in the US -- is it not the case that we'd say Mass IMR is high in 19thC US, and so won't Mass life tables overstate birth rates?

</p>
<p>2021.1110 Ji to write up Alter-issue results. Key result is that 1900's 11-14 ages points to 1890 as high IMR!
</p><p>Done working with Yasuba and his sources; two issues here -- the Alter challenge, being claims that under-counting of infants invalidates our method; and geographic and temporal variation in the US, in order to conjecture bounds to IMR at census benchmarks 1850-1930.</p>
<p>Via Yasuba look at Whipple 1917 for attention to Boston and towns circa 1830-1845. Whipple's estimates have u5 mortality increasing over time, and an urban penalty (presumably closely connected). SSMLit has details. A small Boston u5 population has an unhealthy-looking SR5. So too does 1860's Suffolk Co (mostly Boston) and New York city. Various pop figures are in my .wk4 file. Also, U5 mortality in Boston 1845 about triple that of towns of average health circa 1830. Possible we can connect these to urban/rural IMR:SR relationships from early 20th C?
</p>
<p>2021.1106 (and from 1105) summary on Alter issues:
1850 fPUMS SR2 104.7  SR5 103.8   1860 ages 10-14 104.4 and 11-14 103.6 (age 10 107.0, with age-heaping suspected ). Census values for SR5 among total white (not just native-born):    
103.3 (2.8965 m) in published census and
103.7 (2.9028 m) in fPUMS -- 0.22% greater count of kids
CONCLUSION: SR5 at least 103.6    
  
1900 presumed most accurate for infant ages. 
1900 fPUMS SR2 & SR5 102.5 -- worse than 1850.

Note that using 1900 to infer 1890 -- 102.3 for 10-11 and 10-14

BTW we can accept the consensus that 1850 is worst for undercounting infants (various allusions to 1850 Compendium saying 1 as smallest age-value reported: not seen in Jim's inspection of pp1-30; nor in his search at Google books -- might be able to look at <1 vs 1 in 1850 vs 1860; or look to see if district level is visble in 1850 full count)


</p><p>2021.1103 
continuing on G Alter's concerns ... yes, 10-yr-old populations are greater than infants of the previous decennial census. But the 10-14 cohort SR values corroborate our picture .... 

1850 vs 1860. We see most plausible undercount of infants here, with 1860's 10yr-olds 122% of infants (but 11yr-olds just 92%). But the 1860 SR values point to healthy kids (10-14 104.5; 12-13 103.8; worst is 13-14 103.2);  (10 107)

1860 vs 1870  1870s 11-12 102.6  13-14 102.3  10-14 103.2  10-12 103.6  (10 105.8)

1870 vs 1880 -- use 1880 and get SRs of 3+  (10 105.2)

1900 vs 1910; via 1910, the SR is a little less male (0.5); 10yrs later, we see about 96% as many kids, with a slight tendency to see more girls. You could argue for less undercounting of infant-boys, or figure it is higher male mortality. In any case, nothing to suggest the 1900 was healthier than we claim. Using 1910, 1900SR seems 102

Recall, 1900 enumerated DOB and age, so it is most precise. 
<br>
1860's 10-yr-old pop is 122% of 1850's 0-yr-old count. Consistent with Alter's suggestions of undercounting of infants and of age-heaping at age 10. Interestingly, the effect is stronger for boys than girls (124% vs 120%), which does not give evidence of boy-biased SR0 in 1850 ...<br>
Look at 1900 and 1910, when age-enumeration is supposedly improved ...Generally, looks "better" than 1850 to 1860 ... Fine point to consider: June 1, 1900 vs April 15, 1910 ... <br>
1900 census day June 1; bday recorded, and age at last bday;     
1910 census April 15; bday **not** recorded, just age at last bday; instruction on MS to omit children born after April 15. <br> The 1910 census thus is 6 weeks short of 10 years after the 1900 census (6 weeks or 6/52=11.5%). So kids born April 15-May 31 1900, age 0 in 1900 and age 9 in 1910. Thus we have some 1900 infants showing up in 1910 as 9 year olds; similarly, some of the 15-year-olds in 1910 would have been 15-9.9 years or 5.1 years in 1900. So what does that imply for what we'll see when we compare a 1900 cohort to 10-yr-older cohort in 1910? With 1910 10yrolds missing the youngest of the 1900-infants, it is missing kids who in 1900 were relatively more male (before mortality had taken them), so the 1910 cohort is expected to be somewhat female-biased?

<p>working on G Alter's concerns.

2021.1022 Regional data seems in reasonable shape -- but 1911's "compartemti" u5 data don't total up to the national -- and the 1921 summary volume indicates that the compartmenti are within older boundaries than the 1921 data ... something to look into?<br>

2021.1021 two avenues to pursue for ITA. First, identify if and when Southern regions start to look sensible in terms of SR:IMR. Second, interrogate ITA births/deaths data with reference to population and immigration (the wild card?)

2021.1020 likely Italian story is that the major northern regions fit our story, with the southern regions a bizarre jumble of very male-biased sex ratios that seem unrelated to infant mortality (maybe we want to break Italy in two?). No sign of excess female mortality after 4 ... Some more data to be entered to pin down patterns; and some reflection/discussion in order (for footnotes at least).

Perhaps we want to use the 1876-1880 IMR with the 1880 HMD SR data (just 5 years post-census); and could pair 1881-85 IMR with 1885 SR, etc ...

SR values are about the same from the two sources, but HMD counts tend to be up to 1% larger. PUMS are full-count, so perhaps we'd prefer those. But the SR values again are about the same. So the question is whether we have concerns about the IMR data.

2021.0710 Ji sees Galloway's Prussian IMR is much above Knodel's -- 240-250 vs 205-210. Why? 
Gallardo-Albarrán (2020 EHR) seems to match Galloway's?  Next step: find basis of Knodel's IMR values.


2021.0709 Ji looking for steps to complete the data-collection. 

Prussia, Germany, Austria should be ready for Jesse (who will need to estimate IMR rates from births and U1 deaths?). Jim still needs to check Prussian IMR rates in Knodel vs Jahrbuchs. NOT COMPATIBLE?

From Knodel, Germ IMR data in 5yr averages for 1872 to 1943  His Appendix has disaggregated data

Maybe lack of breastfeeding in rural areas will pull IMR up to urban levels?  Looking at van de Walle (1986) on Euro IM and see that 1860s Bavaria's urban IMR is just 104% of the rural (Table 4.3) -- that from Knodel 1974 Table 4.6 with rural Bavaria >300 until 1888 and Munich ~400 1862-75;   and shows Prussia rural ~200 and ~220-240 for cities and up to 300 for Berlin 

<p> Girls are stronger than boys when it comes to bearing burdens of disease and malnutrition. It follows that challenging conditions for bearing and rearing children take a greater toll on boys than girls, tilting infant sex ratios towards girls.

Lengthy play with West 11 & 13  --  U5sr differs by 0.6  with 2/3 from qo and 1/3 from 1q4  -- but then I see that qo fem mort advan is only 15% and there is no 1q4 fem advantage.  So key is q0 relative to 1q4 for the effect ... And we see that West has no female advantage past infancy?

For the 19th C, anomalies in "urban" variable in the IPUMS full-count dataset: for New England, 1870 to 1880 "urban" pop falls from 60% to 40%
For a more consistent defintion of urban for the 19th C, we might use [CITY](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/CITY#comparability_section)
1850 and 1880: The city of residence is given if the household was in one of the nation's 98 largest cities.
1860 and 1870: The city of residence is given for households in any city with 10,000+ inhabitants
1900 and 1910: The city of residence is given for households in any city with 25,000+ inhabitants.

110 Alleghany PA is listed in 1850-1900, but thereafter b/c it was annexed by Pitsburgh


As IPUMS-USA explains

    URBAN indicates whether a household's location was urban or rural. It is one of the most used geographic variables and one of the most problematic. Definitions of "urban" vary from year to year - see the background and comparability sections - but the term generally denotes all cities and incorporated places of 2,500+ inhabitants. (All areas not classified as urban are designated rural.) 
    Background: The Census Office first used an urban definition of 8,000 or more inhabitants in the 1880 census, and provided a tabulation of the number of places designated as urban and the size of urban population back to 1790.  ... 

From [PUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/URBAN#comparability_section) 1850-1940: The urban area is made up for the most part of households in cities and incorporated places with 2,500+ inhabitants. Also includes households in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island towns (townships) containing a village or thickly settled area of 2,500 or more inhabitants and comprising, either by itself or when combined with other villages within the same town, more than 50 percent of the total population of the town. Also includes townships and other political subdivisions (not incorporated municipalities) with a total population of 10,000 or more and a population density of 1,000 or more per square mile.

From 21.0519: revised urb/rural (stricter definition of urban in 19th C, to standardize, eliminating small towns included in 1860 but not 1880, by PUMS). The variable "CITY" 

can use the 1880 city variable to identify larger cities (among the top 98 that year), and to purge the very small ones. Among the 98 largest is Chelsea MASS, with just 21K people -- so for 1900 and later we might think to switch to non-zero city variables -- NO -- 1900 MASS urban variable still includes tiny towns, like Beverly pop 13K -- but maybe that is because it is a Boston suburb.
The 1880 city variable in nonzero for the 98 largest cities only; 1860&1870 are for pops of 10K+ (so presumably include 1880 cities, and more); 1900 and later uses 25K as the cutoff. Ji wants to use 1880 city names for 1880 and earlier. Although PUMS says 1900 has 25K cutoff, Greenwich CT is included
<br>Jesse finds the 1880 NewEngland urban/rural anomaly in our PUMS -- Ji to confirm it is a PUMS problem -- use extract #39 which is all US kids 4 and under. It is a PUMS problem.

<p>New urban/rural split seem to make much more sense; but the PUMS-based evidence on urban penalty seems iffy to me -- with time, I'd like to compile census-volume-based urban/rural splits.
With revised urb/rural (stricter definition of urban in 19th C, to standardize, eliminating small towns included in 1860 but not 1880, by PUMS): NewEngland urban penalty in 1850 via SR5 was 1.7 (101.5 vs 103.2), now it is 2.5  -- both are large, and larger than the SR2 versions; the SR2 penalty now is 0.5 and it had been 0.2 --- for me, a reminder that the PUMS seem iffy?

</p><p>Questions for Jesse, re: P&H's Fatal Years.
1) Narrow -- Fatal Years Table 2.5, Surviving-children method, q(5) values for Total Pop (vs White or Black) are 176 197 173   ... But the q(5) for the younger women (ages 14-24) is HIGHER than the q(5) for the older women: 197 vs 173.  Doesn't that suggest that mortality got worse over time?
2) Broader -- What does our IMR (0q1) claim imply for P&H finding of declining 0q5? Are they finding a 1q5 decline, and extrapolating to find 0q1 declines too? Or are they "finding" a 0q5 decline, so that if IMR was not-falling, 1q4 was falling even more?
Is it: they find 10% decrease of 1q4, with constant IMR, 0q5 dropped 5%?
Or: they find 10% decrease of 0q4, with constant IMR, 1q4 dropped 20%?
And, of course, the conflict between our results and theirs is greater to the extent that we find IMR increasing 1880s to 1900s .... 

We suspect IMR rose from the 1880s to 1900; but to conflict least with P&H, we could allow IMR to jump in mid 1880s and be flat into 1900s. I.e. we find IMR did not decline in 1880s & 1890s. What does that imp

Fatal Years key empirical result (claimed) is a q(5) value of 18% for 1895, which represented an improvement from 10 years earlier, probably from 20% to 18%  .... that falls out of the West model LT levels which in turn show both q1 and 1q5 dropping 10%.

Given the lack of birth and death registration for the US and its regions for our period of interest, we cannot directly corroborate our claim that declining infant sex ratios (boys per girl) across the last quarter of the 19th C reflected rising infant mortality and deterioration of maternal and infant health. However, we have two places/cases/polities with well-reputed vital statistics for the period of interest: Massachusetts and England and Wales. For these polities, we observe both infant mortality rates and infant sex ratios (boys per 100 girls, age under-two), and we find striking affirmations of our interpretation. 
<p>Figure 10 plots the IMR series for England and for Massachussetts across the entire 1860-1990 period, including lines representing the 3-year moving average of the plotted (annual) values. The conformity between those two series is remarkable. Different trends might be discernable before 1900.^[For Mass, we see a two-part path, the IMR rising in the 1860s, followed by a plateau. For England, we see a very shallow U-shape, with the IMR rate tending to sag in the 1860s and 1870s, and rise in the 1880s and 1890s.] But two patterns are critical for our purposes. First, IMR was high and not falling in the period 1860-1900. Second, starting at the turn of the century, infant mortality rates trace a sharp downward path. The English series drops from about 150 circa 1900 to under 15 by 1950?; the Mass series drops from about 160 circa 1900 to under 15 by 1957.   
 [FIG 10]
In what should be a familiar line of argument by this stage of the paper, the collapses of infant mortality
shown in Figure 10 are predicted to raise the ratio of boy to girls among the populations -- with infant mortality bearing more on boys than girls, the downward path of infant mortality would tend to have saved relatively more boys than girls from an early demise. Figure 11 plots the infant sex ratios (SR2, number of boys per girl, under-2 years of age) for England and Mass over the period 1860-1990. For The sex-ratio values are available at census benchmarks for Massachetts; for England    .... UMMM ... MAYBE ENGLAND IS SR1?

Jim suggest we use West-model simulation of SR2 to extrapolate back from the Bell-Miller SR2-curve. In practice, this means subtracting 0.571 from the predicted SR2s from the IMR, using various "Levels" of the C-D "West" model life tables, and an assumed SRB of 105. 
</p><p>DETAILed musings: We are interested in the effect on SR2 of (say) the conjectured 100-point fall in IMR from mid19C to 1900 ...  Haines 1855 229 to 1895 129; Hacker 1855 234 to 1895 121  ... West Model IMR drop from 230 t0 130, SR rises 101.0 to 102.9  or 1.9 points per 100 pt of IMR ... Issue for us, is the West model shows less effect of IMR on SR than the B&M model does, and so the West model predicts SR2 of 102
</p><p>Hacker's 1890s value for IMR is 121 for whites, which might not be far off of the Bell-Miller USA IMR of 1900 -- 133.1 -- if the black IMR is 225 (104 above the white IMR)^[With blacks 11.6% of population, for an aggregate IMR of 133.1, 12.1 points about the White IMR, requires black IMR (12.1/.116) above white.

HSUS has IMRblack at 170 in 1900 and 340 in 1850s, so maybe 225 is plausible. Even the HSUS 1900 value implies an aggregate IMR of about 126.5, which is not to far from the Bell&Miller value.

<p>suggested wording for outline:
<br> * There was a veritable collapse in the infant mortality rate (IMR) in the USA from the 19th century to the later 20th century -- with infant mortality falling from 15 to 20 percent or more, to less than 1 percent by the 1990s. 
<br>DETAIL: Research to date puts US IMR values in mid-nineteenth-century America in excess of 150 per thousand (HSUS, Hacker 2010).^[IMR values for the US in the 19th century are quite conjectural, but it seems likely that the US infant-mortality experience circa 1850-1860 was comparable to that of England and France and Germany.] By the early 1990s, rates under 10 per thousand were a source of national embarrasment (with the USA consistently ranked outside the top 15 nations; see e.g. Liu, Moon, Sulvetta, Chawla [1992:105](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193257/) on "The very unfavorable infant mortality ranking of the United States in international comparisons."^[The US ranking has only gotten worse since Liu et al. wrote: 30th in 2005 MacDorman and Mathews [2009](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db23.htm#highinfant); 47th in the World Bank's IMR [Table for 2019](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN), accessed 2021.0426]
</p><p>* However, beyond our confidence in enormous improvements since the 19th century, there is a remarkable lack of basic empirical knowledge on the timing of the _mortality transition_. As Preston and Haines (1991:49) pointed out over three decades ago,

>  Little is known about trends, levels, and differentials in American mortality in the nineteenth century. It is not altogether clear when or even whether mortality declined in the United States during the period

</p><p>* For the US as whole, the IMR is available starting in 1933, when national registration of births and deaths commenced (as Texas was added to the birth and death registration areas (BRA, DRA)).^[Registration of Births by/with the federal government started in 1915 with NY; over time additional states were  brought into the BRA] dates back only to 1933.] That series is plotted as a DARK GREEN (Jim hopes) line below -- which starts at about 50 per 1,000. The DK GREEN line traces out substantial progress in reducing infant mortality over the last 2/3 of the 20th C. But it is also appears that the most of the progress in reducing infant mortality from high mid-19th- century levels had occurred by the time for which relatively robust/reliable IMR estimates are available. 

</p><p>*  Our knowledge of mortality generally and infant mortality specifically (our focus), is (impaired/prevented/blocked/blunted) by a lacunae/lack reliable data on births and deaths.

</p><p>* From **1915**-1933, we have IMR from the Birth Registration Area, a subset of the US. Treating that as at least suggestive of national trends, we see evidence of IMR on the order of 100 at the time of WWI. Again, suggesting important progress in the 20th C, while still leave open the question of when the US escaped the NAME-THE-PEAK? -- leave alone questions of where and when and whom and how or why. 

</p><p>* Before 1914, IMR is estimated using life table models, calibrated to census data. These are very conjectural. Suggest that circa 1850 the USA was like England or France  (not surprising for a country where 1/7 of the pop were enslaved; surprising for a rural place ... )

</p><p>Thoughts/Perspectives on the paper: 
<br>Do we need to pay attention to child vs infant mort?
<br>Maybe issue is whether US is like France and England, with IMR transition after 1900; or like Germany, with IMR transition in 1850/1900 period. Note that [England life expectancy](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/ourpopulationwherearewehowdidwegetherewherearewegoing/2020-03-27) in England grew 1850s to 1900, without IMR decline. I'd say female e0 goes from 42 in 1850s to 47+ by 1900. By early 1930s, female e0 is 62 (so 1/2 decade +5 and 30year +15). 
</p><p>AggregateMortality vs Urban:  e.g. Condran & Cheney refer to "The mortality decline which accompanied the process of industrialization in Europe and the United States" (p97, first line of their papere); but they actually trace out decline of Philadelphia death rates ("decline of crude death rates between 1890 and 1900").
</p><p>re: Current Consensus of Mortality. footnote or text pointing out need for care in intertreting repeated references to declining urban mortality, because population redistribution from low-mortality rural areas to high-mortality (but falling) urban areas tends to raise the aggregate mortality rate, even as mortality reductions within areas tends to pull aggregate mortality down.
<br>E.g. Gallardo-Albarrán on Prussia from 1877-1913 -- reports that infant mortality in German cities "declined by almost half" from the 1870s to WW1 (p731). In conclusion, they write, "This article has studied the causes of the first sustained decline in mortality in Germany by looking at the role of public health infrastructures." Interesting to note the German U5 is 100.5 in 1871, 1880; 100.7 in 1890, 1900; then 101.4 in 1910; big rise comes by 1925 with 103.4.

<p>Use 1940 Negro U5 and U1 to extrapolate single-year age values from the nonwhites in PE-11 for that year. I use Negro SR01 and SR05, I assume age1 SR is same as age 1to4 (via U5-U1), and assume age1 is the same fraction of ages1-4 as in the nonwhite PE11 data. That gives me age 0 and age 1 girls, boys are via SR. Then scale up/down via PE11 nonwhitepop relative to cenvol nonwhite pop.
Maybe do a simpler way? NonNegroNonWhite are 5% of Nonwhites. so the Nonwhite sex ratio is    5% * NonNegroSR + 95% * NegroSR

</p>
J&J working on life-cycle angles.
<p>In the US life tables for 1949/51, most of the racial gap in the SR1 comes from the racial gap in the SRB. Birth registrations put the Black SRB 3 points below the white SRB (102.4 vs 105.4); Life Table infant mortality rates put the Black SRB 3.8 points below the white (102.0 vs 105.8).    </p>
<p> SRB = (q0-qf0)/(qm0-q0)</p><p>
An SRB is embedded in the life-tables for any time (total, male, female): SRB=(q0-qf0)/(qm0-q0) </p>
<p>Exposition: infants dying during the year (d0) is the sum of female and male deaths. Let m be the share of births that are male, and f be the share of births that are female; then SRB=m/f (from simple algebra^[SRB=MaleBirths/FemaleBirths; divide top and bottom by total births T=MaleBirths+FemaleBirths; then SRB=(MB/T)/(FB/T)=m/f]). <br>
Further, total q0 = m * qm0 + f * qf0 -- the total q0 value is the weighted average of the male and female q0 values, where the weights are the male and female proportions of births. Those weights sum to one, m + f = 1<br>
 So q0 = m * qm0 + (1-m) * qf0 = m * (qm0-qf0) + qf0
And so m = (q0-qf0)/(qm0-qf0). By similar reasoning, f=(q0-qm0)/(qf0-qm0)=(qm0-q0)/(qm0-qf0) and SRB=m/f= (q0-qf0)/(qm0-q0) 



</p>
<p>Note that circa 1960, birth registrations are deemed 99.3% complete for whites, 96.4% for nonwhites. For whites, if male reg is 99.5 and fem is 99.1, then effect on SRB is that the observed 104.9 would reflect a true value of 104.5; the nonwhite 102.0 -- if 96.8% and 96.0% and would actually be 101.6.

<br>1890 census volume SR2 for New England is surprisingly high (103.0), SR5 less so (102.1); that reminds there is likely a lot of noise in our data, so we need to avoid cherry-picking results we like and bypassing those we don't. For validity/robustness, consider using the SR5 as a corroborative indicator.
<p>Suggest adjusting MidAtl 1850 SR5 down from 102.8 to 102.4, based on review of fullPUMS and census-data. DETAILS: PUMS values are high for NJ (0.6), NY (0.5); 0.1 low for PA    
1850 SR0 PUMS values  are high for NJ (2.4). My adjusted value reduces MidAtl 1850 SR2 by 0.4, to 102.4 
</p>
<p>1870 New England PUMS and census are discordant. Census SR2 is 102.0 but PUMS gives 101.6 
Most of the discord is from MASS -- averaging the census & PUMS values for MASS yields SR2 of 101.8 which fits better with the 1860 and 1880 SR2 values (102.3).
</p>
<p>1910 MASS PUMS is 0.7 under census, but that seems to wash out in the NewEngland aggregate.  
<p>Looking at discrepencies between PUMS full count and Census volumes. For example, PA 1940 census has U1 134,379 but fullPUMS has only 127,152.  I pulled all PA counties from the fullPUMS and looked at U0 as share of U5 -- it ranged from 15% to 20% and I found no weird outliers to explain the undercount</p>



### Mission Highlights ###
<p>21.0412 SR2 values are [now assembled](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5qga1jyo5jipris/SR-USA-Rbased.wk4?dl=0), New England, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, and EastNorthCentral (full-count PUMS for USA 1850-1940; censusVolumes for 1950, 1960; Haines ICPSR for 1970-1990). Census-volume data is in a [spreadsheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rhp9boaojyflr0t/USkidsForR.wk4?dl=0) for easy conversion to R.  We need to put some time into reviewing the data to check for validity. Basic result is that the sex-ratio evidence puts the onset of infant mortality decline after 1900 (1-point declines in SR2 from 1880 to 1900). <br>
In all 4 census divisions, we see 1-point declines in the SR2 from 1880 (and earlier) to 1900&1910. After 1910, in the North, by 1930&1940 SR2 is at new levels; but another rise of SR2 comes after 1940 (to current 105ish values). SouAtl white-SR2 has not fully recovered by 1940; in 1990 it is at new levels (105.9)</p>
<p>As of 1950, to what extent are SRs at their late 20th-C levels? 
The Southeast's SR rise comes later than the NE and ENC: the 1960s is the watershed. But racial gap persists; 1960-1990 see a 2.5-point rise in the Black SR2. </p>
<p>Signs of a 1950s fade in the SR2 (NE -0.7, MA -1.0, ENC -0.7, SoAt -0.8). 
</p>
<p>Canada's SR2 values are generally better than those in the USA in 1870 & 1880; than similar to US North  from 1900-1940. WIth Quebec usually worse, Ontario usually better.</p>

<p>1880-1900 SR2 declines  
In the Northeast, from 102 to 101; in the MidWest, from 103 to 102. The MidAtlantic's SR2 tends to be about 0.3 points above New England's. And ENC SR2s tend to be 1 point above the MidAtlantic's.<br>
The South's SR2 is dominated by the racial dimension. The white SR2 drops 1 point or more, from almost 105 to under 104. The black SR2 hovers in the 98-99 range from 1870 to 1940; by 1990, that SR2 has risen about 3 points (almost 102).</p>
<p>Canada's SR2 values are generally better than those in the USA in 1870 & 1880; than similar to US North  from 1900-1940. WIth Quebec usually worse, Ontario usually better.</p>
<p>Modern SR2 values (over 104.0) achieved across Eastern Canada by 1971.

Looking at Ekamper & vanPoppel (spell?) on Amsterdam -- IMR rates 1812-1919 show a pronounced decline from 1882ish to 1918 (1848 250, 1882 230, 1918 70) <br> Those are roughly consistent with the rising SR5 seen in Mitchell's Euro Hist Stats.<br>
There we see SR5 values 1840-1879 about 101;  1889 101.7  1899 101.8 1920 103?

<p>Messing with IMR stats for 1900-1930, I conclude they are a fool's game. The lack of geographic variation is simply not plausible? And I simply do not believe that the deep South's rates were so low. Consider Miss. with 1921 IMR 68.4 from white rate of 52.8 and nonwhite 84.6 and then Miss. in 1940 with white IMR 46.6 and nonwhite 60.6  -- virtually no change in white IMR? Looking at Miss SR2, 1920 value is 103.1 (whites 105.0) and 1940 is 
<br>According to vital statistics, 1930 has fairly narrow band of IMR rates. Georgia's 77.4 is high, Illinois' 55.8 is low. My simulator suggests IMR 77 vs 56 gives SR2 102.6 vs 103.0.

</p>
<p>1900 census Vol III (see lit file) discussion makes it clear mortality poorly enumerated/registered. So with a grain of salt, we'll explore infant death rates as validators/contradictors of SR. Starting with MASS (where we have HSUS IMR as well as DRA stats). 
<br>Mass 1920 to 1929/31 (1930 missing?): U1dr falls enough to expect a 0.9 point rise in the SR2. PUMS rises 2.3 points. MAYBE 1920 SR2 is rubbish via 1918 flu?
<br>Mass 1910 to 1920 is not helpful: IMR fall is enough for a 1-point SR2 rise; instead, there is a 1/2 point decline in PUMS and 1.8 point decline in cenVol.
<br> Longer form -- MASS DRA show U1 death rate falling 1910-1920 from 16.1 to 11.1 (0.70), Boston's falling less, 16.6 to 14.2. Mass IMR looks same as U1dr, with 1920 69% of 1910.
<br>PUMS-SR2 drops 0.55 point, from 102.1 to 101.6 -- Pvalue on the Drop, 31%.
A drop of 1 point would have p-value 16% (low enough for me to see a fall)
In my simulator, IMR 111 drops a 104 to 102, IMR 161 drops it to 101. So via my simulator, the IMR decline predicts a 1-point rise in SR2 from 1910 to 1920
</p>
<p>
</p>
<br>Looking for 1900 death rates, to go along with 1910, 1920 rates. 1900-1904 report offers number of deaths of U1, which I could link to U1 populations ...
<br>Need to see whether 1910, 1920 rates are deaths per U1 ... 
<br>[1910 Mortality](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsushistorical/mortstatbl_1910.pdf) pdf2 TOC Tables 2 and 8 132-39  might tell me ... try CT 3476 u1 deaths (pdf50p54)
Mass 

<p>2021.0401 
In 1910 & 1920:
<br>Detroit's U1 death rates are much above the state's (1.6 in 1910, 1.2 in 1920).
<br>MASS and Boston have about same 1910 U1 death rates (vital stats), but 1920 sees
Boston 28% higher. Vs Mass, Boston's 1to4 DR is much higher, 40% in 1920 and 13% in 1910.
Yesterday pulled IMR for Mass from HSUS, to see that the IMR decline there only starts in the mid 1890s (from 160ish in 1890/95). <br>
MASS IMR 1900s 21-pt drop 1910s 36-pt drop, 1920s 30-pt drop, 1930s 22-pt drop. By 1940, IMR under 40.

<p>2021.0331 From chat with Jesse: Jim to pin down Southern data, to look for examples of "good" IMR data and see how such cases relate to SR evidence. </p>
<p>Jim checks Mass -- which does not see an IMR decline until the late 1890s. 5-year moving averages    1860 ~130   1870-1890 ~160 1895 158 1900 147  1910 126    1920 90     1930 60
First good-looking SR2 for MASS in 1930's 103.8 ()<br>
Add Klein (200?) The one index that would begin to change in profound ways after the Civil War was the mortality rate, which by the late 1870s
was finally beginning its long-term secular decline.

have IMR below 12% until after 1910. 

IMR improvement does not comes well after 1900
For example, Haines in HSUS says "The Massachusetts data reach reasonable quality by about
1860" ... From HSUS, we can pull the annual IMR series for MASS. There we see IMR does not start to decline until the later 1890s.  1870s-1890s bounces around, averaging about 160.
By 1900 it is about 150, and it tends to fall thereafter; 1910 130; 1920 90; 1930 60.<br>
Big declines 1910s 130 to 90 (predict 0.7 rise SR1? 101.9 to 102.6)  1920s 90 to 60 (predict 0.5 rise SR1? 102.6 to 103.1)  and also 1930s 60 to 36 (predict 0.4 rise in SR1? to 103.5)<br>Also 1880 or 1890 imr160+ suggests SR 101.3 




There we find IMR in the range 130-165 in the 1860s, and stay high and variable into the early 1890s. Use a 5-year moving average to smooth it. 1880 157     1890 162    1900 147   1910 126     1920 



<p>2021.0329  Thinking racial disparities will be a focus when we present CEA ... if so, we have the "Blacks have a genetically low SR" claim to fight ... why about Atlanta suburbs in 1990 or so? Not much help -- do get 103.2 for suburban blacks ...

Illinois SR2 (102.4-104.3) PUMS 1900-1910 slight dip (102.4, 102.6), recovered by 1920. Emergence of racial gap, 1950; SR2 104.0,   white 104.6 black <100. Before 1950, nonwhite population 5% so white and overall SR2 about the same.

<p>2021.0323 
<br> recap for Canada: late 19th C good, then a fade, and rebound. Late 19th C 103-104, then Canada's SR2 is somewhat low (102) 1901 to 1931,  but looks very good (104.5+) 1951 onward
<br>
<br>Ontario looks healthy (103 or better) throughout; and "good" 1951 onward (104.4 or better).
<br>Quebec not bad until 20th C: 1901-1931 100-101 range; rising to 105 in 1961; good since (104.5+)
<br>Yesterday about completed CDA data. Interesting to find that 1971 single-year of age is actual counts (but rounded to nearest 5) but 1961 and 1951 are inferred from U4 counts and vital stats (registrations of births and death) and immigration. What about before 1951? And does that mean we should focus on SR5 for 1961 and 1951? Or maybe same basic picture?<br>
Ontario lowish (103) SR in years 1911-1931 or 1941
SR2 declines 1881 (104.5) to 1921 (102.7), recovers by 1951, on to a new high in 1961 (105.1, since >104.3)
SR5 declines 1871 (104.1) to 1901 (102.7), stays low until 1931 (103.0), then to new high in 1961 (105.0)

<br> 1891 in both QU and ON the SR5=SR2; 1951 QU SR2 103.6 below SR5 103.9 (only time)

NY state SR2 suggests the mortality transition started after 1900, and not in the 1870s.<br>
tot/rur/urb: 1880to1900 declines of 1.4  1910s and 1930s clear rises (1920s smaller rise) 
<br>1950 onward the emergence of the race issue in NYC (and elsewhere?)
<br>In 1900, the SR2 and SR5 have their nadirs <br>
1930 sees both the SR2 and SR5 move above previous peaks, and in 1940 they break above 104.<br>
1930's urban SR2 of 103.4 is a full point above the previous peak (102.4 in 1880).<br>
The 1900 nadir is evident in NY as a whole, in the rural SR2 (but maybe 1910 was worse?), and in the urban SR2 (nadir), an for NYC (but 1850 1/10 pt lower)
<br> Figure out:  NYC 1920 to 1930: census SR2 shows just 0.3 rise, others 0.8 and more

PUMS shows improvement via urban rise while rural drops a litte
</p><p>
NY state infant SR suggests mortality increased during the period 1880 to 1900, recovering by 1910, with lower mortality by 1930, and new lows by 1940.<br>
An urban penalty is evident until 1910, but it was not large ... For a large SR2 gap, consider whites and blacks in the USA, white advantage of over 4 points (1900 to 1980).<br>
The urban penalty was largest in 1850, at 2.8 points (1860 1.8, 1.3 in 1870, 1888)
</p>
<p>NY state via fullPUMS SR2 ... SR2 falls 1880 to 1900 (102.9 to 101.3), recovers by 1920, 1940 gets to postwar plateau (104-105 range)
1850, 1860, 1880: 102.9  (1870 slip to 102.1) <br>
rural/urban gap at least 1.2 points through 1900, but 1900s see the collapse of the urban penalty. <br>
Both rural and urban SR2 drop 1.4 points from 1880 to 1900. So what about 1890?
<br>
Rural SR2 slips from 1880 to 1900, from 103.7 to 102.3, and bottoms out at 102.0 in 1910, before rising to recover and reach a new high in 1940.<br>
Rural: at least 103.6 in 1850, 1860, 1880  ... 1890?   </p>
<p>1890?<br>
1880 to 1900 drop is 0.7 per decade in both urb and rur (and more overall, with shift to urb)
<br>
NY's nonPUMS SR values in 1880 and 1900 are similar to the PUMS, so consider them ... <br>   
SR2 drops 1.2 total, 0.5 in the 1880s and 0.7 in the 1890s <br>
SR5 drops 1.0 total, 0.3 in the 1880s and 0.7 in the 1890s <br>
1870 sees a 0.8 point drop in the NY SR2 (Pvalue about 5% )
<br>


</p>

Working out results for NorAm mortality ...

NY State PUMS vs Census -- SR2 1910 PUMS is 1 point lower (and SR5 is 0.6 lower); the other 6 years SR2s match well (worst is 1900, PUMS 0.3 lower; else gap is 0.1 or less)
SR5 1850 is also off, PUMS is 0.5 higher; 1910 PUMS is 0.6 lower; other 7 are good.
So SR2 6/7  SR 7/9


Fullcount Massachussetts ... not promising. Bounces around, 1850 to 1870 slide down, jump up in 1880, then back down in 1900, 
**CENSUS & FULLCOUNT NOT SAME**

MASS SR2 traces out decline 1850 to 1870, 1880 bounce-back. 
 1940


Boston full-count IPUMS, 1870 to 1880 jump in SR2  (~99 in 1870 & 1860, 1880 101.7 1900 102.2) 
Boston FullPUMS   SR2 1880 101.7 (14.5k)   1940 102.4 (18.2k)


Very wide plausible range? Population too small?
Note 1940 census pop for Boston U2 is 18.9k which is the same order of magnitude

 The Bourbeau et al life tables are based on next to no evidence. <br>
 ... provincial jurisdiction, ... don't get consistent, co-ordinated vital registration until the 1920s. <br> Emery paper
 Did you ever see the attached paper by Herb Emery’s father? I think it is in his (Facts of Life) book as well.

In other countries census survival data would be more useful but less so for Canada because of the size of southward emigration. It would be a contribution if you can get infant mortality from early life sex ratios. You could compare your method of getting at infant mortality with McInnis (I think in the Pop History of North America) or with DBS and provincial estimates from the 1920s (by then more reliable). Heck, doing it for Ontario alone might be really helpful – a single jurisdiction but big enough population to capture small effects.

By the way, prisoners seem to have a similar height pattern to soldiers insofar as no increase is visible for birth cohorts before 1900. I think the school studies suggest signs of an increase not long after 1900. <br>

2021.0214

Philadelphia U5 1880 102.2  1900 101 Hmmm ...  1950 104

Does literature recognize the timing of mortality decline is not determined yet?
e.g. Cutler & Miller (2005 Demog): "A substantial mortality 'penalty' to living in urban places therefore developed as American cities grew during the 19C (Haines 2001), n5: Historical data limitations make it difficult to pinpoint when this mortality penalty first emerged.

Condran 2008 refers to late 19C mortality decline -- maybe folk presume so, from econ growth -- but evidence.  Questions about welfare in 19C

Temporal -- 1900-1933 US Census publishes Mortality Statistics for "Death Registration Area", 10 states 1900 SEE Haines (2001 Annals Demog --) and Hacker (2010 Hi Meth?)





### stuff below is to be reorganized

### highlights     

2021.0312  
19C Boston too small to say much (e.g. 1900 2/3 CI is 2.6; while NYC's is 1.0)

2021.0312  Jim wasted 1/2 day via Echavarri paper (Cliometrica) with "elevated" sex ratio arguing for missing females sort of discrimination. <br>
HarrisBe (2008 ResEconHist) "Gender, Health, and Welfare in England and Wales since Industrialisation." Mostly about post-infancy mortality stuff ... maybe we will want to look at for some recent perspective on england's mortality transition ...

2021.0303 Illinois plot is suggestive of U shape, trough in 1900. Postwar urban penalty (unlike the Northeast?). 1880 CHicago is the only total-pop value below 101; otherwise need to look at nonwhite/black SR2 values, which are 98 and 99 in 1950-70  Black-SR2 for Illinois 100.8 in 1990 ...  

North American Mortality paper: the 1900 nadir? 1880 to 1900 decline in SR2, SR5  MA NY PA

PA is difficult to interpret. <br> 1880 is odd for collapse of urban penalty, as urban SR2 jumps up 1.5 points, and rural slides 0.3 ...  <br>
1900 is odd for 1.8 drop in SR2, from a 3-point drop in urban SR2. Then SR2 jumps up 3-points 1900 to 1910 ... That 3-point blip seems problematic -- <br>
And the census volumes and PUMS full-counts often don't jibe: 1870 PUMS SR2, SR5 are lower than the census vols -- esp the SR5 which is 0.7 points lower (101.2 vs 101.9); the PUMS SR2 in 1870 is 0.36 below the published census -- 102.2 vs 102.5 ...   <br>
CENS SR5 1850-70 102.5 to 101.9, and rises 1880, 1890 102.7, 103.3 
<br> About 102 in 1870, rises to 102.7, 103.3 in 1890; drops to 101.5 in 1900; stable-ish until 1930 - 1940


[Submitted abstract](https://www.dropbox.com/s/widf7dyubuefpzx/AbstractSubmitted.txt?dl=0) for Urban Penalty Paper   
<br>
For mortality paper, looking at USA 1860 to 2000,  "racial" differences in SRs are most dramatic; less striking is the path toward 1990/2000 healthy SRs. Until 1990, the black SR2 tends to be 4 points below the white. By 1990, NY state's SR2 rises 4 points from a nadir in 1900. State of NY SR2 rises 3.4 points in the 160 years after 1860. <br>
<p>**Chicago** <br>
Postwar issue of SSMA versus urban area versus Chicago proper ... E.g. 1960<br> 
6.79m (1950 5.59m) 789k U5 "Chicago-NW Indiana Std Consolidated Area" <br>
6.22m (1950 5.18m) 712k U5 "Chicago SSMA"; but 1950 says: 5.495m  1940 4.825  
3.55m (1950 3.62m) 381k U5 "Chicago" -- 1950 says pop 3.62 -- good fit!
We use city of Chicago?

Navara [(2014 PLoS One)^["Low Gestational Weight Gain Skews Human Sex Ratios towards Females] reports SRB of 100 to 117 for pregnancy weight gains of 20lbs to 60lbs, and generally her effects seem very strong -- maybe overly so? Is it from her "binary p4 logistic regression analysis"?

[Some problems related to the collection of demographic data in the population censuses taken in Latin America during the 1980s](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12314803/) Arretx C, Chackiel J. **Maybe relevant to Rodrigo's point about demographers and measurement<br>

Crew (1948 pages 108, 112 among 30 results in search in GoogleBooks version) Our interest is based on Teitelbaum (1970 JBiosS) saying "Crew (1948) extended this proposition from the family to the community level, arguing that if a socio-economic effect is at work, rich communities would be expected to exhibit higher live-birth sex ratios than poor communities."

#### older highlights

**SRB & Birth order** Maybe negative birth-order effects on SRB are SES effects, with higher birth orders proxying for family-size (as in Hanushek 1992 JPE) which in turn proxies for low SES. Or is it son-biased selection? with people ending childbearing when they get a son? Punnett's tables have some striking examples, which I see as reflecting stopping once a son is "achieved" ... 


For JIH, list of key milestones/ancestors of our arguments:

SRB&SES: ?Almond&Edlund (  );      Klasen (1994 WorldDev ); Naeye et al. (1971 Pediatrics); Teitelbaum & Mantel (1971 JBiosSc c102) & Teitelbaum (1970 JBiosSc c115); Winston (1931 AJSoc c48); Reg-Gen 1921 Pt 2 (cited in Russell 1936) for SES & SRB in England and Wales; Punnett 1904 for SRB falling with SES in London. 

**Issue**  "sociobiological interpretation" as per Abernathy and Yip -- refering to Trivers-Willard idea that higher SES people favor sons ... p280 "If a competitive edge (because of health or social position) enhances  male reproductive success, then parents should work especially hard to  give sons a good start. Moreover, since reproductively successful men  can make a greater contribution to inclusive fitness than women who are  reproductively successful by female standards, well-off parents should  maximize their advantage by concentrating on sons." Can we ignore the socio-bio BS? I hope so, maybe by implicitly adopting A&Y's alternative: p288 "A plausible challenge to the sociobiological interpretation of the present findings is that the convergence of infant boys' and girls' mortality in the high social status sector occurs because of the female physiological advantage and because child rearing at this pinnacle is so good. That is, the marginal gains still possible for girls are nearly zero, whereas boys, who are more vulnerable ... can still derive  significant incremental benefit from the best care"

2021.0207 Ji got *Fatal Years* yesterday, noticed remark that South Atl had low infant mortality. Will check Va, SC, Ga ... <br>
In 1900, white SR2s in South 103-104; better than the Northeast's Mass NY  PA which are about 101.  But what would they look like if you dropped off the poorest 1/2 of the population?
<br>
1900 US SR2 102.2 (white 102.8 black 98.5)  MA 100.9  NY 101.6  PA 101.3 OH 102.2 Ill 102.3  MI 102.7   MS 101.3  GA 100.6  KT 103.5  MO 102.8 TX 103.8

2021.0205 Ji delineating NE-US SRs path over 20th C ... lots of questions; e.g. city of Philly SR2-white: 1950 105.6  1960 103.8 -- with 3.5% decrease of white population; does a 1.8 point decline make sense?
<br>
USA 1850-2000 <br>
e.g. New York & NYC, 1860 sees fairly small SR2 gap, NY 102.9 with NYrural 103.6  and NYurban 101.8 and NYC 102.3 (does NYC include some rural in 1860?)<br>
For State of NY, some SR2 decline 1860&1880 to 1900: NY 102.9 to 101.6; rising to peak in 1940, 104.7, some decline to 1960 trough 103.1; growth since, to 105.1 in 1990. So SR2 says small (1.3 point) decline 1880 to 1900; sizable (3.1 point) rise 1900 to 1940. Small (1.6 point) decline 1940 to 1960. Recovery by 1980.<br>
NYC, for now, we can trace out the SR5: in 101-102 range 1860 to 1910, with a modest rise from 1900's 101.1 to 1940's 104.2, then sag in 1960 & 1970 (with a remarkably low 97.8 nonwhite SR2 in 1960). 
<br>PUNCHLINE: USE FULL-COUNT IPUMS data. Although interested in urban mortality/health from 1860-1960, we generally lack cities' urban SR data until 1880, and then it is SR5. SR2 starts with the 1910 census. For 1860, with the full-count IPUMS, we have SR1, SR2, SR5, for cities. We can get full-counts for 1880 1900 data there?
<br>SRusa0states.wk4 sheet called "presenting".

2020.0131 found 1960 data, by state, SR1 etc, and from CDC SRB. 1960 SR1 urban/rural 104.7/103.8
1960 low nonwhite SR2 in Phil 99.0  NYC 97.8 Chicago 97.9  nationwide: ?
1980 show SR improvement, but maybe we need to look to 2000 for further SR gains? If so, a contrast from height data, where 1950-2000 shows no gains.

2020.0129 looking at MASS in 20C   1950 census v2  maybe Tab33p53 for Boston?   1910 I notice Boston is small, compared to Chicago, and the SR cycles across low ages (as if heaping at work?)

Boston & MASS <br>
1940 Boston SR a little lower than the state -- SR5 103.3 vs 104.0    SR2 102.6 vs 103.7  Conjecture the bigger gap at SR2 reflects child mortality is much lower than infant. Urban MASS more generally is similar to state, because MASS is only 11% rural at this time!

Pre-famine Ireland:  consensus that it was poor but healthy (taller than English -- but all might be pretty short?).   
*IMR* is an unsettled issue (JRI not aware of others). Mokyr 224 per K, and others suggest IMR above other Europeans. But the SR1 is inconsistent with that sort of IMR, absent mortal female-gender bias.<br>

2017 [paper re:scarring](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/169141/1/898645573.pdf), suggesting famine culled the would-be-short ... heights of prisoners suggests ?  I THINK IT SAYS only extreme famine culled (tall survivors); e.g. not extreme near Dublin, there it scarred (short survivors)
2004 Oxley     the development gradient .. Ulster was the most developed, followed by Leinster and then Munster, while Connaught wasthe poorest. Deaths by starvation -- both absolute and relative to population size -- were exactly the inverse of this gradient ...   Arguably, mortality was driven not by the crisis of a sudden crop failure, but by an ongoing level of destitution and enduring hardship that weakened resistance (Ô Grâda 1995: 3). <br>
1996 Mokyr & OGrada, 1996 OGrada:  tall via good diet, but poor    <br>

1988 Mokyr & OGrada (EHR 1989) healthy & literate, but poor. *IMR* 50% higher than Britain  -- that is Mokyr's? BUT OG 1988 suggests low mortality.    
Mokyr 1983:9  misleading/misreading Kane (1845)

... the pre-Famine Irish were relatively tall and well fed 


1993/1988 OGrada book ([Ireland Before and After the Famine](https://archive.org/details/irelandbeforeaft00ogra/page/n5/mode/2up)) p46 "argue tentatively in favour of 'light' child mortality" 

1989 OGrada p38 In the end, whether due to overpopulation or other factors, there is no denying the gradual decline in the living standards of the poor, the bottom half or so of the population before 1845.26 The shock of Phythophthora infestans would have had less of an impact in an economy with a larger margin to spare. (referring to M&OG 1988 EHR)

1988 Mokyr & OGrada EHR,  "Poor and Getting Poorer? Living Standards in Ireland before the Famine"  p211 The Irish poor almost certainly grew poorer during the half century or so before the Famine, but overall average incomes  probably rose. This implies a sharpening of the inequality of income distribution. (end of intro)<br>

     Concerning the death rates for young children (aged 1-4) the ratios were much higher, with urban mortality being 94% higher in 1890 and 100% higher in 1900. For infants the excess urban mortality was 88% in 1890 and 48% in 1900.    ... The rural urban differential seems to have been true earlier as well. For seven New York counties in 1865, the probability of dying before reaching age five was .229 in urban areas but .192 in rural locations (Haines, 1977).

### US Slavery

West & Shearer 2018 WoHiRev  start with light-work assignments of pregnant women

2017 Schneider EHR    epigenetic: good conditions in utero -- foster catch-up growth after a dreadful childhood     this article argues that the tremendous catch-up growth experienced by slaves is inconsistent with Steckel’s assertion that slave birth weights, a proxy for health in utero, were incredibly low. Adaptive theories of human growth suggest that poor conditions in utero have long-lasting effects on the growth pattern of children, especially in limiting catch-up growth. Thus, it is more likely that slave children experienced relatively good conditions in utero and had higher birth weights than Steckel argued.

Note from [Plowden's Report on the census of India ... 1881](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/012155211)  (1883 p. 53)

     In the Registrar General's Report of births, deaths, and marriages, in 1880, for England, the male births are given as 103.6 to 100 births of girls, and the following remarks are made:—  "There are two curious facts relating to this proportion of male and female birth, neither of which has as yet received certain explanation. The first is, that the proportion of boys to girls is smaller in England and Wales than in any other European country; and the second, that the proportion has been gradually but steadily diminishing for many years past. Comparing England and Wales with other countries, we have the following figures, which give the average number of male births to 100 female births for the 10 years 1870—79, or for those years out of the 10 for which the necessary statistics are forthcoming:—  "As regards the other point, the following figures show the gradual diminution in England and Wales of male as compared with female births:

Great quotation about SBR 106 and the frail male "At birth 106 males appear for every 100 females ...; yet, by the law of nature, -- a law seen in still more powerful operation even in intra uterine life -- the tendency to succumb under disease is so much greater in the male than in the female, that by about the 18th year of life the proportion of the sexes becomes equalized, 100 males being alive at that age for every 100 females"

U% mortality rate ... has a number of advantages over the infant mortality rate as a composite measure of health risks
at young ages. In particular, the indirect demographic techniques for measuring the under-five mortality rate are more robust and less sensitive to assumptions about the underlying patterns of mortality than the infant mortality rate (28, 29)

Data obtained from the complete registration of births and deaths provide the best possible basis for the direct estimation of child mortality. Unfortunately, such data are available for only 55–60 countries.d

CLRIFY THIS: 1911 census has 102.2 (graduated) and 102.1 (Table 43), both close to the S92 value of 102.0;  1901 value of 100.5 (1911Tab43,1901Tab16) 1901 census has 100.6 as the graduated estimate, 100.5 as the value Tab16 via fems/thousand males age 0, in 1901 and 1911 census.

London 1841 is given with and without Lewisham and Hempstead -- probably more rural-like, but too small to matter
"Original homelots were not divided up extensively until the 1840s, when enriched by the burgeoning whaling industry, New Londoners began to seek land for dwelling houses in outlying neighborhoods close to the center of town."
From Wikipedia The Official Illustrated Guide to South-Eastern and North and Mid-Kent Railways of June 1863, by George Measom, describes Lewisham as follows: 'Lewisham Station, situated on the slope of an eminence amidst picturesque scenery, beautiful green meadows rising abruptly to the summit of the hill on the left, dotted with handsome residences and gardens, while the Common is seen intersected by various cross roads and studded with country inns and houses on the low ground or valley to the right. The area of the parish is 5,789 acres... Lord of the manor, the Earl of Dartmouth to whom it gives the title Viscount'.

     some other cause is at work to produce so great a numerical inequality of the sexes: and the info so widely collected in late years, together with the fact that females are more numerous among Mahomedans than Hindoos, and among low castes than high castes, have forced Mr.Plowden (p3) to the conclusion that the disparity is mainly due to the wide prevalence of the practice of female infanticide, including in that workd not merely active deprivation of life but also neglect and disregard in the rearing of girls.

From 1881 census (Plowden p. 54)   
    the actual disproportion between the sexes, though it might exist to some extent, and to what extent it was impossible then to say, was not anything like so great as had hitherto been portrayed by the census statistics.
 ... the nearer we approach to accuracy in the Census of a general population, the more clearly does the fact appear that there is nothing peculiar in this country in the proportion of the sexes; that if there are from 104 to 106 females to every hundred males in Europe, this proportion also obtains in India, that is in all parts of the country where female infanticide is unknown. The truth is that the great bulk of enumerators have been singularly obtuse in comprehending the fact that the counting of females was a matter of any importance in census work. To understand how this is, we must take into account **the low estimation in which females are held in this country,** and also the reticence of the people on all matters connected with their female relatives. In the registration of births and deaths the same error obtains. **The birth or death of a female child is considered such an insignificant matter,** especially among the lower classes of the population, that a great number escape registration in certain districts; and, from the causes adverted, to the numbering of the female population in 1871 was undoubtedly erroneous in so far that many were omitted in the Census schedules. But in districts where the Census work was well done it will be found that the female population is invariably in excess of the male; in fact, the general accuracy of the results of any district may be judged of by the way in which the proportions of the sexes have been recorded."

p178  It is obvious that a wave of infecundity has during the last few years swept over at least Northern India, and that the five years between 1876 and 1881 have seen a far smaller number of births than took place between 1871 and 1875.

These observational studies lead to inconsistent findings regarding whether poor maternal nutritional conditions reduce the proportion of male births among human. One possible explanation for the inconsistent results is omitted variable bias.     ....     
p2888 That the abrupt decline in the proportion of male births first occurred to those who were conceived more than half a year after the famine began suggests that the earlier studies based on the Dutch Hunger Winter and Leningrad Siege failed to recover consistent evidence regarding the relationship between maternal famine exposure and offspring sex ratio at birth because the duration of the famines was insufficient.

Cites Waldron to back up nice summary statement of infant-female survival advantage:    

      Equity in survival between females and males does not imply equal mortality rates (that is, male-to-female ratios equal to 100). Under circumstances where boys and girls have the same access to resources such as food and medical care, boys have higher mortality rates than girls during childhood, and the examined ratios would overall be expected to be greater than 100.
And she continues, explaining the bio advantage.^[Newborn girls have a biological advantage in survival over newborn boys, with lesser vulnerability to perinatal conditions (including birth trauma, intrauterine hypoxia and birth asphyxia, prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal tetanus), congenital anomalies, and such infectious diseases as intestinal infections and lower respiratory infections [4]. However, beyond early infancy, girls do not enjoy the same advantage in relation to certain infectious diseases, which are the primary causes of death in later infancy and early childhood in settings where overall mortality is high [5],[6]. Thus, the sex ratio of child mortality (that is, mortality at ages 1–4 y) is generally lower than the sex ratio of infant mortality (Figure 1).]   And has useful statement re: missing women^[Earlier studies have found numerous countries in many regions of the world, particularly southern Asia, eastern Asia, and northern Africa/western Asia, where mortality at ages 1–4 y was higher for girls than for boys [1],[10],[11]. India and China in particular have a long-documented history of female disadvantage in mortality that is covered in an extensive literature [12]–[25].]

    Our analysis of 15 developed countries shows that, as infant mortality declined over two centuries, the excess male mortality increased from 10% in 1751 to >30% by approximately 1970. Remarkably, since 1970, the male disadvantage in most countries fell back to lower levels. The worsening male disadvantage from 1751 until 1970 may be due to differential changes in cause-specific infant mortality by sex.

MIXED FINDINGS FOR OUR VIEW (some are nonsupportive, not falsifying -- they get a reduced SBR via high-carbo low-sat-fat diet)
 In particular, a diet high in saturated fats but low in carbohydrate leads to the birth of significantly more male than female offspring in mature laboratory mice, whereas when calories are supplied mainly in the form of carbohydrate rather than fat, daughters predominate. As the diets fed to the mice in these experiments were nutritionally complete and because litter sizes did not differ between treatments, dietary inadequacy seems not to be the cause for sex-ratio distortion.      
     Large ruminants
The prediction that females in better body condition would produce more male than female progeny has been observed in red deer [14, 22, 23], roe deer [24], mature ewes [25], reindeer [26], Barbary sheep [27], domestic pigs [28], and a number of other species, although there are exceptions [13, 29]. Dairy cows, but not heifers, on a high plane of nutrition give birth to proportionately more bull than female calves than cows on a poorer diet [30]. Repeat breeder cows, i.e., ones that have problems becoming pregnant by artificial insemination, also tend to produce more males [31]. The data on roe deer [24] were obtained with farmed animals on a diet controlled for low- and high-energy intake by varying the oil content. In that study, 75% of the calves born to the high-energy does were male, while the low-energy group produced only 46% males. Most other studies have been performed on wild populations, which are less well-controlled.

most weight-gain mothers lower SRB: 98.6 vs 103.2  
Jongbloet attacks -- This runs parallel with optimization of the ovulatory and conception pattern, as argued extensively elsewhere (Jongbloet, 2004a,b), e.g. in ameliorating socio-economic conditions, during prime reproductive age and prime ovulatory seasons, optimal restoration of the post-partum ovulatory pattern, etc. In contrast, male-biased conceptuses occur in the less optimal conditions, while SSR reduction occurs only in extremely unfavourable conditions, and only then as a consequence of inappropriate implantation and perishing male-biased pathological fetuses    .... Analogous SSR reversal associated with reduction in fertility is also elicited by other severe population stressors, such as a bombing attack in Croatia 
Cagnacci replies ... Italy and Black USA evidence "probably indicates .. that the sex ratio increases with amelioration of caloric availability and reduction of undernutrition"


Cagnacci, Renzi, Arangino, Alessandrini, Volpe (2003), oddball piece. "The data showing a prevalence of females in seasons with reduced fertility, and by contrast, an increased prevalence of males in seasons with increased fertility, support the hypothesis that a greater attrition on males is exerted in all those situations in which reproductive conditions are sub-optimal.

<br>Credibility impaired by citing Calle et al. BMI thing for males are more frail.<br>
Jongbloet attacks ... "The conclusion of Cagnacci et al. (2003) that more males than females are conceived in seasons with more favourable reproductive conditions challenges the well‐known V‐shaped probability of delivering more male offspring at both the onset and the end of the fertile window, versus equal gender proportions at the time of ovulation in the mid‐cycle (Guerrero, 1974; Harlap, 1979; James, 1996)."  ... but for us, concludes OK:  "in the most constrained conditions, the SR becomes inverted due to excessive loss of male‐biased (pathological) fetuses."<br>

1994 Klasen (1994 World Dev)  Strong statement of SBR rising with income/SES and implicitly, with economic development.    
Klasen (1994) gives us 1980 Matzdorff 1971 Teitelbaum & Mantel; and via Google Winston 1931 AmJSoc: p12 "prenatal mortality is heavier for the male"  pp20-21 "The sex-ratio of man at  (21) birth is a resultant of the sex-ratio at conception, such sex-ratio constantly being reduced by a prenatal mortality which bears more heavily upon the male than upon the female fetus. This mortality is importantly affected by social factors which operate indirectly through affecting the mother’s ability to provide the necessary optimum conditions for survival.    
Klasen also useful for West Life Table understates male IMR disadvantage   p1064 "Coale’s “West” Table assume that the survival disadvantage of boys is comparatively modest.”10 (n10: at LE=40 West Table male "the absolute disadvantage in the male probability to die in infancy is 29.7/1000. In the Model Life Tables “East” used below the disadvantage is much larger, namely 36.5/1000.)  But, once again, this assumption is likely to be a peculiarity of the countries that make up the “West” Tables and could be a result of preferential treatment for male infants rather than the “natural” state of affairs. The higher fragaility of male infants is likely to lead to a particularly large biological disadvantage in a high mortality environment so that in those populations the sex ratio of mortality in infancy should be higher (Waldron 1983, 1985, 1987)." Waldron sex-differences in mortality. Probably Waldron 1993 for Euro men higher mortality via drink/drive/violence     
Klasen 1994 Emphasis on SBR increase with SES. "The biomedical literature suggests that the reduction in stillbirths and late fetal mortality alone could account for these increases." For a discussion, see McKeown and Lowe (1951) and Klasen (1994b).   ...  See Teitelbaum and Mantel (1971) and Matzdorff (1980)

After considering excess female mortality in ages 1-9, Klasen (p1064) says    
      
      A second and much larger question relates to the size of the male-female mortality differential in infancy. There is little doubt that in infancy boys have a clear survival disadvantage vis-d-vis girls (Preston, 1976; Lancaster, 1990; Waldron, 1987).

[p112-13 The reasons for this low masculinity are not understood.]      In the developing world recently, and perhaps more importantly in the past, the females carried out much of the work in the fields and had their general well-being disturbed by high fertility rates. Under such conditions the sex differentials might well be low (i.e., in favor of the males); differential rates of infanticide would act in the same manner.

Summary It has been  shown  about  that  50  out of  80 values  of  the sex ratios  of  births registered  during   1949-1958  in  76 ter-ritories  reputed  to  have  relatively com-plete  vital  registration   fall  within  the usually  stated  limits  of  104-107.

In  the light  of  other  historical evidence on the sex ratio at birth  among the  negroid  populations,  one is  led to conclude  that  there  operates, among the negroid  populations,  some genetic  or ra-cial factor  making for a slightly lower sexratio  at  birth  than  among  the non-negroid  populations.

Ploss in Panunzio 1943 "Are More Males Born in Wartime?"       Assertion 7. There is a tendency for the sex ratio of live births  to increase as the socio-economic status of the mother rises.  Since it is well known that birth control is practiced to a greater degree in the upper classes, there is a possibility that this factor  may affect the sex ratios in favor of males" (? stopping after male achieved? ) Refers to Winston then " Again in the present study, no attempt is made to test this  hypothesis. However, in the discussion under "Hypothesis II" it will be seen that the data in Table C do not support this  assertion.

Answers yes. Useful for Savorgnan (1936)who connects SBR to female health p287 As Gini and Savorgnan have pointed out, there is no evidence that a correlation exists between the quantity of nutriment and sex at birth [that in context of malnutrition of mothers claimed to raise SBR in wartime]   p288  Fifth, the most reasonable hypothesis is that of Savorgnan, who  has made the most complete study of the masculinity phenomenon.  This may be called the birth-interval hypothesis. Briefly stated,  Savorgnan maintains that masculinity in births increases in war-time on account of the greater intervals between births, which, in  turn, produces greater rest in the female reproductive system and  thereby brings about the birth of a larger number of males. ...   But how do greater intervals influence the rate of male births?  Savorgnan replies, by producing more prolonged rest and recovery  in the female reproductive organism, which, in turn, reduces the  rate of abortions and stillbirths; and since the proportion of males  in abortions and stillbirths is always higher than that of females, [p289]  the reduction of abortions and stillbirths increases the proportion of males actually born. The effect of stillbirths and abortions in  reducing the rate of male births is well-established in some coun-tries, especially in Germany and Hungary    p920 counterexamples from Egypt and India high SBR and high frequency birth

p192 The higher male mortality during infancy in part is due to what might be regarded as the extension into post-natal life of the factors responsible for the  high masculinity of stillbirths. Thus  one notes the great difference between  male and female infants relative to the  mortality from prematurity and from injury at birth; both conditions discussed already in the previous section

Savorgnan franco *Corso di Demografia* (Pisa 1936)

Winston (1931 AmJSoc). p12 "prenatal mortality is heavier for the male"  pp20-21 "The sex-ratio of man at (21) birth is a resultant of the sex-ratio at conception, such sex-ratio constantly being reduced by a prenatal mortality which bears more heavily upon the male than upon the female fetus. This mortality is importantly affected by social factors which operate indirectly through affecting the mother’s ability to provide the necessary optimum conditions for survival.


Bawkin 1929 Hu Bio p. 90 "The higher mortality of male infants has been a subject of interest for a great many years. In a paper read before the Royal Society of London in 1786, Dr. Joseph Clarke, a Dublin physician, pointed out (91) that the mortality of males exceeds that of females in almost all stages of life and especially in the earliest"

Greenwood & Newbold (1925 Biometrika)["On the Excess Mortality of Males in the First Year of Life"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2332084); explores Lenz's (1923, in German) argument that increased infant mortality will reduce "the *relative* excess of male mortality"  -- his reasoning is that "a larger fraction of total male mortality in infancy is selective than of female mortality", so "when a non-selective factor, or relatively non-selective factor, such  as a prejudicial general environmental change, e.g. a hot summer or an outbreak of an epidemic, heightens the whole of the mortality of the first year of life, the relative excess of male mortality should be reduced." Lenz looks at the correlation between the ratio of male to female mortality rates and "the rate of mortality on both sexes in 11 series of annual rates of mortality for different countries (in most cases the number of years included is very small, 8 or 10, in only one does it exceed 40) and he finds that in the great majority the value of r is large and negative."

There are two other SBR papers with Ethiopia Gibson & Mace (2003 PrRoyalSocBiol) (who happen to say "There is some evidence that male foetuses are more susceptible to exposure to toxic substances, but results on the effect of maternal nutritional condition on sex ratio are inconclusive (Lazarus 2002).)" **Is that BS?**  Hohmann & Garenne (2010 EcoHuBio c17) look at wealth, child and adult mortality in Uzbezistan and sub-Saharan Africa.

The 2001 sex ratio is comparable to past years (1,048 in 2000), and has changed very little over the past half century. Similar to previous years, Asian or Pacific Islander (API) mothers, as a group, had the highest sex ratio (1,067). The sex ratios for individual API subgroups varied considerably, however, from a high of 1,092 for Chinese mothers to a comparatively low 1,000 (equal numbers of male and female births) for Hawaiian mothers. As in previous years, the sex ratio for all Hispanic mothers (1,038) was about midway between non-Hispanic white (1,051) and non-Hispanic black (1,032). Persistent differences in the sex ratio between groups may be due to environmental and/or maternal conditions (26–28)   26. Davis DL, Gottlieb MB, Stampnitzky JR.

CDC Deaths 2017 Infant mortality In 2017, a total of 22,335 deaths occurred in children under age 1 year (Tables C, D, 14, and 15). This number represents 826 fewer infant deaths in 2017 than in 2016. The ratio of male to female infant mortality rates was 1.2, the same as in 2016. The infant mortality rate was 5.79 per 1,000 live births, the neonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants aged 0–27 days per 1,000 live births) was 3.84, and the postneonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants aged 28 days through 11 months per 1,000 live births) was 1.95 in 2017 (Tables C and 13; Figure 7; see Technical Notes for information on alternative data sources). Changes in the infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality rates from 2016 to 2017 were not significant.

### Life Table Implications ###
NOTE on simulations of SR1 via SBR, IMR, and relative male/female IMR. Which are in the [WK4 spreadsheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/89gi1z7ewpyv3qh/SR1%20simulations.wk4?dl=0). Perhaps obviously, the time-pattern of infant deaths affects the SR1, as early deaths pull down the SR (because the excess male births play a smaller role in the cumulative SR1). To illustrate the magnitude of the effect: 23% IMR early-death pattern sees SR drop of 3.4 while even-death pattern has SR drop 2.4; 11% IMR early-death SR drop of 1.6 and even-death SR drop of 1.1. DETAILS: with 104 225(250/200); with my idea of realistic (.5,.15,.14,.1,.1)  104 goes to 100.6; with even 104 to 101.7   OR IMR 113(125/100) 104 to 102.4 vs 104 to 102.9   So the bigger effects occur at higher IMR and higher male excess IMR ...

2010 Anderson & Ray (2010 REStud) ["Missing women: Age and disease"](https://economics.ubc.ca/files/2013/05/pdf_paper_siwan-anderson-missing-women-age-disease.pdf)    
The paper is utter garbage. They use subsaharah Africa's relatively high death rates of women of child-bearing age to argue for missing women. And US 1900 women are dying in childbirth, creating the appearance of "missing women" there.  GARBAGE  twisting of fact that economic development has hugely reduced maternal death (and that male behavior-based deaths in rich nations is most of male deaths until old-age) ... Consider their calculation of subsaharan missing women age 20-24: their counterfactual (CF) female mortality is via the female/male rate of developed world. Devoloped has death rate (ages 20-24, throughout what follows) for males 2.94 times the female (1.1/0.4); subsahAfr male mortality is 5.7, so CF female mort is 5.7/2.94 or under 2 ... actual female mort is 9.4, so the female mortality among subsaharan women is be 9.4/(5.7/2.94) or  4.85 times actual mort.  And they use UN/WHO death rates for U1 and 1-4 to argue for missing girls in subsaharan Africa. But I bet if we looked at sex-ratios by age we would NOT see evidence of missing girls ... I bet the death rates approach and a sex-ratio approach will give opposite reulsts for subsah africa ...


ABSTR:  ... ; (2) as a proportion of the total female population, the number of missing women is largest in sub-Saharan Africa, and the absolute numbers are comparable to those for India and China; ... Finally, using historical data, we argue that a comparable proportion of women was missing at the start of the 20th century in the United States, just as they are in India, China, and sub-Saharan Africa today.   
1263  For each category—age, and later, age and disease—we posit a “reference” death rate for females, one that would be obtained if the death rate of males in that country were to be rescaled by the relative death rates for males and females (in the same category) in developed countries.6 We subtract this reference rate from the actual death rate for females, and then multiply by the population of females in that category. This is the definition of “missing women” in the category of interest   ...  In sub-Saharan Africa, the sex ratio at birth is [p1264] approximately 1.03, much lower than for developed countries as a whole (which is 1.06). There appear to be genetic differences that determine this ratio.7   n7 Indeed, the sex ratio at birth for whites in the United States is around 1.06 whereas for blacks it is 1.03. The available data for births from sub-Saharan parents in the United States suggests similar numbers as well.    

their counterfactual calculates: male death rate (dm) rescaled by relative death rate for males and females in developed countries  counterfactural df (cfdf, their uw) cfdf =  dm* devdf/devdm     Suppose age 20s developed nations women don't DIE from childbirth, as they do in poor countries -- maybe

In the Model Life Tables “East” used below the disadvantage is much larger, namely 36.5/1000.)  But, once again, this assumption is likely to be a peculiarity of the countries that make up the “West” Tables and could be a result of preferential treatment for male infants rather than the “natural” state of affairs. The higher fragaility of male infants is likely to lead to a particularly large biological disadvantage in a high mortality environment so that in those populations the sex ratio of mortality in infancy should be higher (Waldron 1983, 1985, 1987)." Waldron sex-differences in mortality. Probably Waldron 1993 for Euro men higher mortality via drink/drive/violence

 excess girl-mortality via differential treatment (p. 150)^["Some studies show, for example, that within the same family, different treatment may be given to children according to their sex, especially in societies in which the preference for boys is very strong, resulting in excess mortality for girls. This has been especially demonstrated in Bangladesh (Chen et al., 1981), in Algeria (Vallin, 1979b), and in China (Calot and Caselli, 1988, 1989). This phenomenon was formerly evident in Europe (Pinnelli and Mancini, 1992, 1999; Tabutin, 1978).]

### Language choices (rhetoric/clarity) -- MORTAL NEGLECT & FRAIL MALE
In the context of using sex ratio differences to test for sex discrimination, we use the phrase **mortal neglect** to refer to deliberate and malicious? witholding or withdrawal of the minimal care and attention required to keep an infant or child alive (or prevent them from dying?). This is about the usage of Lynch (), and is quite different from the meaning of the phrase as used earlier by Scheper-Jones (referring to neglect of "doomed infants" -- in which case neglect hastens an imminent death). 
In the context of identifying the biological/physiological bases for male-biased infant and child mortality, we use the phrase "frail male" to refer to the male's greater susceptibility to disease and lesser resilence to malnutrion CONGENITAL STUFF too? IS THIS? This is somewhat narrower than the usage of PSYCH-GUY (DATE) who addresses the broader range of pyshc and emotional needs of boys and men, in the context of arguing for more nuturing? Challenging current stereotypes of masculinity and binaries of gender?   
OLDER COMMENTS^[Choosing our terms: mortal neglect, selective neglect, of girls? If the former, we need to footnote and clarify that we aren't using it in the sense of Scheper-Hughes). Jim's current (200618) sense is we use the term mortal neglect, and **not** in quotation marks. Instead we define mortal neglect as a *lack* of care and attention that substantially increase probability of death (like by 10%-points or more -- issue is additive, not multiplicative). Scheper-Hughes refers to *withdrawal* of care, suggesting initial care that is rescinded).]

#### Spain
For lit review only (Tapia & Gallego-Martinez allude to declining SR1 and worsening conditions )
Tapia & Gallego‐Martínez (2017 EEH, 2020 EHR) Use sex-ratios to look gender discrimination; uses European SR04 for comparisons 
2017 p120n22 The decline in the sex ratio during the last third of the 19th century might be related to the worsening of living conditions during the first stages of modern economic growth (Martínez-Carrión and Pérez-Castejón, 2002, 421). 

2017EEH Where are the missing girls? Gender discrimination in 19th-century Spain  
5 The demographic transition in Spain did not start until the late 19th century and the early 20th century (Dopico and Reher, 1998). Anthropometric evidence confirms the deplorable living conditions existent in mid-19th-century Spain. See, for instance, Martínez-Carrión and Pérez-Castejón (2000), Martínez-Carrión (2002) or Moreno-Lázaro (2006)

2020EHR What explains the missing girls in nineteenth-century Spain?   2020EHR repeats 2017 discussion of SR1 and SR04 and Spain's suspiciously high sex ratios. 
2017 p Therefore, instead of around 105.9, infant sex ratios in the absence of gender discrimination should have been expected to be somewhat just below parity (99.4) in mid-19th century Spain.19
