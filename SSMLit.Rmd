<br> p5Before considering the relative numbers of boys and girls in the Greek censuses, it is important to note that child sex ratios in the past are not comparable to contemporary ones because mortality levels during infancy and childhood have a direct influence  on sex ratios in these age groups. Due to the survival advantage of females, harsher environments are especially deleterious to boys (especially during the first years of life), thus increasing their relative mortality and resulting in lower sex ratios. Following the estimation in Beltrán Tapia (2019, pp. 5–6), Figure 2 plots the available information on infant mortality and child sex ratios (ages 0–4) in European countries between 1750 and 2001 and illustrates the negative relationship between these two variables. According to these estimates, infant mortality of slightly below 200 deaths per 1,000 live births (in line with the values reported for Greece during the second half of the nineteenth century [Valaoras 1960, p. 132]), should yield child sex ratios of around 101 boys per 100 girl

Before the general massive drop in this century, there were wide differences in levels and trends of infant mortality among European regions, among countries, and within each country.

Easterlin (1999 EurRevEcHi) "How beneficent is the market? A look at the modern history of mortality"
<br>(Abstract, p257) A short answer is, not very. In contrast to economic growth, where the free market is commonly viewed as a prime mover, mortality in the last two centuries has not been greatly helped by market forces. The classic sources of market failure - information failures, externalities, public goods, principal-agent, and free rider problems - have been pervasive. Nor has economic growth itself been behind the worldwide improvement in life expectancy. In the primitive state of nineteenth century health knowledge, the immense rise in urbanisation engendered by economic growth largely vitiated any positive level-of-living effects by increasing exposure to disease. Instead, public policy initiatives, based on new knowledge of disease and new institutions, have been essential to the improvement of life expectancy, both in urban areas and nationwide.</p>
<p>p257 The concept of human development has recently emerged to rival economic development as a worldwide objective of public policy ... In assessing human welfare, advocates of this concept would, at a minimum, place indicators of social conditions, notably life expectancy and educational achievement, on an equal footing with traditional economic measures like GDP per capita and a poverty index ... political and civil liberties. In this article, I focus on only one of the proposed new measures, life expectancy at birth (referred to subsequently
simply as life expectancy).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is fair to say that, so far as life expectancy is concerned, the common reaction among many economists and economic historians is scepticism of the broader measure of human development. This is because improved life expectancy is typically viewed as a natural by-product of <p258> economic development or of the institutional conditions that foster economic development. Thus, elevating life expectancy to the status of a social goal commensurate with economic growth raises no issues that are not already being dealt with in the study of economic growth and its determinants.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is this view to which the present article is addressed. Specifically, the questions of concern here are: (1) is life expectancy largely or wholly a function of economic growth? (2) If not, are the conditions commonly taken to foster economic growth, namely, free markets, private property, and freedom of contract, also responsible for promoting the advance of life expectancy? As a basis for forming tentative answers to these questions, this article examines the nature and causes of the historical improvement in life expectancy
over the period chiefly from 1800 to 1950.
</p>
<p>p261 This Section addresses the presumption that the historical improvement in life expectancy is due to the favourable effect of economic growth on living levels.3 It first presents evidence that the long term trends in life expectancy and economic growth are not closely related, drawing on the record of six countries with relatively good data. It then considers why the relationship between the two has been quite weak in the historical past (see also Kunitz and Engerman 1992).</p> 
<p>We'll use HMD data, so don't fuss with Easterlin's timing. 
<br>
p261 “The first point of note is that life expectancy is marked by a sharp increase in the rate of improvement, starting in the late nineteenth century” ... England 1871  Sweden 1875  France 1893     [oddly, his T1 has only a 12 yr gain in e0 from 1871 to 1921 -- Mitchell shows +17yrs (and I bet ONS does too)]
<br>
p262 Note that Easterlin's choice of 1871 for "take-off" of e0 is very strange -- it relies on decadal life-table values, and has the following values for male e0 q0: <br>
1861 40.51 q0 178, 1871 39.22 q182, 1881 44.18 146, 1891 41.94 177, 1901 45.40 177, 1911 49.36 146.54, 1921 55.98 88.4; (1861 female q0 143.5 e0 43.0) 
<br> in short -- Those life tables do show 1861 & 1901 with same IMR (178,177) and 5 years different life expectancy. And the same pattern is evident in Mitchell's annual series of e0 and q0. But is there any empirical validity to the e0? Or is it just more life-table BS?
<br>
FIGURE 2 Easterlin's 1871 **"take-off"** of e0 -- I average m&f e0 in Mitchell's EHS, there  e0 is 41 1869/71 and 43 1877/79 44 1880/84  45 1886/92 in the early 1890s and 46 by 1900 ... My reading: 1850-71 40-41 yrs  1881-85 45 yrs  1888-1900 46 yrs  
<br>**CAUTION** Easterlin relies on Keyfitz and Flieger (1968) pp36-39 show summary stats from Life Tables. p520 the Life Tables have (male) 1861 q0 177 e0 40.5; 1871 q0 178.5 e0 39.22; 1881 q0 146.74 e0 44.185  
1861 female q0 143.5 e0 43.0 ; 1871 
</p><p>
p265 If the McKeown hypothesis is correct, then the take-off dates for life expectancy should conform closely to those for economic growth. But the two do not fit closely at all (Table 2). The contrast between Sweden and England is striking. Their take-offs in life expectancy are almost identical, but those in economic growth differ by about three-quarters of a century. 
<br>Taken as a whole, the evidence for the six countries suggests that the rapid improvement in life expectancy started later than modern economic growth, but spread more rapidly. In none of the six countries did rapid improvement in life expectancy start before the 1870s, whereas economic growth was underway in two, perhaps three, of the six countries by that time.
<br>p266 My interest here is in the factors responsible for the high rate of improvement in life expectancy post take-off, because it is this improvement that has lifted life expectancy to wholly unprecedented levels. But a brief word is needed about the mild improvement observed in all six countries before takeoff, because of the temptation to assume that this is the product of economic growth. 
<br> In all six of the countries included here^[England, Sweden, France, Japan, Brazil, India] the phase of mild improvement in life expectancy is associated with a reduction in smallpox mortality as vaccination was introduced.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, there is reason to doubt whether the acceleration in economic growth that started in western Europe after 1800 was having any sizeable positive effect on life expectancy. SSome analysts have pointed out that in the middle of the nineteenth century there is a flattening of the trend in life expectancy both in England and France, despite rising income levels (cf. Figures 2 and 4, and Fogel 1994; Schofield, et al ., 1991, ch. i; Szreter 1988, 1997; Vallin 1991). They suggest that the positive effect of economic growth on life expectancy due to better living conditions was countered by another effect of economic growth - the redistribution of population to high-mortality urban centres.4 4 Before its take-off, life expectancy in urban areas was about ten years less than in rural, reflecting the more rapid spread of disease where population density is high and also under the crowded conditions of factory production as modern economic growth took hold ... As the population became more concentrated in low-life-expectancy urban areas, there was a negative effect of economic growth on life expectancy.
<br>Indeed, some scholars argue that the slope of the relationship [e0 & pcInc] in a pre-modern mortality regime may have been negative (Mosk and Johansson 1986). 
<br>270 The major breakthroughs of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that were eventually to bring fatal infectious diseases generally under control can be briefly outlined. They fall under three principal headings:
<br>(1) New methods of preventing the transmission of disease, including education of the public, starting in the mid-nineteenth century, <br>(2) New vaccines to prevent certain diseases, starting in the 1890s, and <br>(3) New drugs to cure infectious disease (antimicrobials), starting in the late 1930s.
<br>p274 The point was previously made that under the mortality regime prevailing in the first half of the nineteenth century - before the onset of sustained advance in the knowledge and technology of disease control - the positive relation between life expectancy and per capita income that would be expected on the basis of improved living levels was undercut by the positive association between urbanisation and per capita income. The differential trend between rural and urban mortality brought about by the new technology of disease control significantly altered this relationship. As unfavourable urban health conditions were gradually removed by the new techniques, and excess urban mortality eliminated, the adverse effect of urbanisation on life expectancy evaporated, leaving only the positive effect of per capita income via higher living levels. Thus the new technology of disease control had the effect of increasing the slope of Preston's functional relationship between life expectancy and per capita income, as well as shifting that relationship upward (cf. Mosk and Johansson 1986, p. 420). 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Associated with the epidemiological transition there was also a take-off in stature much like that in life expectancy ... 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p275  To recapitulate the argument to this point, in the state of knowledge regarding health and mortality prevailing in the early nineteenth century, economic growth had at best only a small positive effect on life expectancy. This is because the positive effect of economic growth via improved living levels was substantially offset by a growing exposure to disease as the population became more urbanised. Only as advances in knowledge led to the development and use of new methods of controlling infectious disease both in urban areas and nationwide did rapid improvement in life expectancy occur.
<br>It is this question - the role of the market in the great improvement of life expectancy - to which this Section is addressed. By the 'market' I mean supply and demand conditions operating within the institutions of private property and free contract to allocate resources via the incentive of private profit to the satisfaction of human wants - in this case wants with regard to the elimination of disease and reduction of mortality.
<br>[lengthy coverage of knowledge and policies for public health]
<br>p287 The control of infectious disease involves serious issues of market failure - information failures, externalities, public goods, principal-agent problems, and so forth. The market cannot be counted on for such things as the provision of pure water and milk, the proper disposal of sewage, control of pests such as mosquitos and rats, the supply of uncontaminated food and other manufactured products, immunisation of children and adults against major infectious diseases, and the dissemination of new knowledge regarding personal hygiene, infant and child care, food handling and preparation, care of the sick, and the like. There is also a serious market failure problem with regard to the distribution of antimicrobials because of externalities associated with the development of disease-resistant bacteria. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  p287  The title of this article posed the question, how beneficent is the market? The ubiquity of market failure in the control of major infectious disease supplies the answer: if improvement of life expectancy is one's concern, the market cannot do the job. Implementation of the new techniques of disease control has required the development of new institutions, centering on the public health system
<br>p288 Rather than a story of the success of free market institutions, the history of mortality is testimony to the critical need for collective action.

<br>p38. On the eve of the First W W the demographic transtion in Europe was far from complete and, in particular, the decline in mortality had a long way to go: indeed it had hardly begun.  ... we are well aware of what has happened since that time, our knowledge of earlier developments is often vague, sometimes confused, and always incomplete. pp40-41 crude death rate graphs [I'll skip, and focus on HMD instead]  p42 1.1 The Reduction of Variability [of CDR]. 
<br>p43 In France, there is evidence of a clear decline in the cdr between 1750 and 1845 (we have no data for earlier <p44> years), but during the following 40 years the death rate did not change appreciably and only resumed its decline toward the end of the 1880s. In England  ... 'normal' mortality appears to have been constnat throughout the 18th C until the 1820s ... brief period of decline which lasted for about ten years ... succeeded by a renewed period of near-constancy ... until the 1870s. After that date, however, decline became rapid and continuous."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most surprising ... is the lower mortality which England seems to have enjoyed, when compared with France, at the beginning of the period. 
<br>1720-49 French CDR 32-35 /k    peak 49 in 1747.  England 1720-49 25-28 /k peak 37 in 1742.
<br>During the following 1/2 C, health standards improved in Fr but not in Eng,  [by 1820] mortality levels in the two countries were similar. Thereafter ... curves similar ... until about 1875, when mortality in Eng fell both earlier and more rapidly than in France ...
<br>p45 It is, however, clear that throughout the 19th c the fall in mortality in both Norway and Sweden was more regular than in either England or France, where there was a period of stagnation. This period of stagnation which occurred later in France than in England (1845-90 compared with 1830-75) seems to have coincided with the years of greatest social hardship caused by industrialization under a capitalist system.

<br> Changes are similar to those that we have traced in crude death rates, though there are some slight differences. underestimation of infant mortality in England (and possibly also in Sweden) at the beginnninng of the 18th C. It is more interesting that between 1845 and 1890 when the crude death <p50 figure; p51> in France remained stationary,  [IMR] curve / was dome-shaped. Infant mortality increased considerably between 1850 and 1870 and did not resume its decline until 1895.  ... most severe period of inzn in France ... deterioration in the health of an increasing proportion of young children ... industrial working class.  young mothers ... work outside their homes ... give out their children to be nursed, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England, the movement of IM until 1875 was almost exactly the same as that of the c d r, which had remained on a plateau since 1830. ... (gains 1875-1885 cancelled by) increase between 1885 and 1900, and it was only after that date (five years later than in France) that a real new decline occurred. More clearly than the crude death rate, the course of IM suggests that the first stage of public-health transition was limited to the end of the e18th and the beginnings of the n19th centuries. From then, we would have to wait until the end of the n19th cent to discern the great wave of mortality decline which was to continue throughout the t20th. The FWWar did not mark the limit of a period of transition, and the cut-off points that have been chosen are, to some extent, arbitrary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... division of the transition into two distinct phases, which was typical of England and France [possibly Norway but data lack] ... did not apply to Sweden. ... IM fell continuously, except for year-to-year fluctuations, from the moddle of the e18th C onwards,
<br>p52 Italy IM "rate declined continuously and rapidly from 1863 onwards and reached the same level as in Eng and Fr by about 1900.
<br>Differences between infant mortality rate in different Euro countries were probably largest around 1850. By that time important progress had already been achieved in some countries (Norw, Swed, Eng, Fr) [Norway ~100; others ~150-160 -- via Mitchell IHSEur and Vallin's figure 3.4]
<br>p66 Hoever, even the limited amount of data at our disposal makes it possible to reach some conclusions about the characteristics of mortality during the two centuries [1720-1920]. Even though the health transition has resulted in a reduction, and later in an elimination, of years of 'crisis' mortality, and the beginning of a reduction in 'normal' mortality everywhere, the overall impression is, none the less, one of extreme diversity. This applies both to the dates when the transition began (the mid-e18th c in France, the end of the n19th c in Germany and Russia) and to the trend of decline (regular and continuous in Sweden for three centuries, a long period of stagnation during the middle of the 19th c in France and England).

<p>Figure 1 presents Prussia IMR 1877-1913. Urban IMR volatile, but seems to start to decline from mid1880s (230-250) to late 1890s (200-220), then steeper decline 1900-1913 (ends at about 150 in 1913). With elimination of urban penalty circa 1901-1906. Rural IMR hovers in the 180-200 range, by my eyeball. p739 Table 1 reports mean IMR 213
<br> As noted, G-A reports that infant mortality in German cities "declined by almost half" from the 1870s to WW1 (p731). Mitchell's IHS says Germany IMR 1860s 300ish falling to 1880s 230ish  1900 205ish (p121,123).
<br>p745 reports the logCDR in sample fell 0.54 (so level fell to 58%), with .109 of that from water & sewage. p746 reports logIMR fell 0.439 (to 64.5%), and attributes 0.108 of that to water & sewage.
<br>In conclusion, they write, "This article has studied the causes of the first sustained decline in mortality in Germany by looking at the role of public health infrastructures." Interesting to note the German U5 is 100.5 in 1871, 1880; 100.7 in 1890, 1900; then 101.4 in 1910; big rise comes by 1925 with 103.4.

The creation of the German Empire after the Franco-Prussian War also coincides with the sustained mortality decline and with improved statistical coverage. The crude death rate declined from 28.9 per 1000 in 1871 to 16.7 in 1910, while the expectation of life at birth (for both sexes combined) rose from 37.0 in 1875 to 48.8 years by 1910. The infant mortality rate fell from 246 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 1869/73 to 170 in 1908/12 (Haines and Kintner, 2000, Table 3 & Table 4). Despite its rapid economic development prior to World War I, Germany was still, however, one of the nations with high mortality and especially high infant mortality. Compare, for example, the infant mortality rates for some other nations for the period 1908/12: Sweden, 75; Norway, 70; England and Wales, 112; the Netherlands, 112; Switzerland, 109; France, 123 (Mitchell, 1998, Table A7).

<br>p41  From a historical perspective the towns in Europe were perceived as extremely unhealthy places with extremely high mortality rates. These conditions have been investigated very intensively for England and Wales. During the nineteenth century, the mortality rates in the rapidly growing English industrial towns and centres of commerce were high and surmounted the average mortality of rural areas and the state by far. To focus on this fact the terms 'Urban Penalty' or 'Le Handicap Urbain' were coined (Kearns, 1988, 1993). Especially, tuberculosis has been considered the archetypal disease of the industrialization process.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A further characteristic of the secular mortality development, however, is the substantial improvement of the mortality rates in various towns in Europe and North-America towards the end of the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth century. The differences between the mortality rates in towns and those in rural areas diminished and the excessive urban mortality rates decreased or even disappeared completely (VoÈgele,1996 [Where he cites Condran & Cheney 1982 Denog ]).

p46  Though Tanner argues for the existence of female robustness in the situations of radiation and undernutrition, there is a dearth of information about sample size and physiological mechanisms.

p51  Johnson and Nicholas (1995) argued that both males and females born between the early 1820s and the mid-1850s in the UK suffered from nutritional stress. 

p53 Also, heights in Kazakhstan – one of the former Soviet republics in Central Asia – have been stagnating or declining, with the height of girls developing even worse than boys’ height due to religiously induced discrimination in the labour market (Dangour et al. 2003).

   According to James Tanner (1962: 127), ‘girls … are less easily thrown off their growth curves … than boys’ and McCance argued that ‘males are more vulnerable [to undernutrition] … and rehabilitate less completely’ (see Thomson et al. 1967).  British Journal of Preventive & Social Medicine

   p65 These findings appeared to reinforce Tanner’s view that girls were more resistant to adverse conditions and that there was more scope for the heights of boys to increase as conditions improved (Harris 1998: 425–8)

     p139 It is generally agreed that adult stature responds less dramatically to environmental improvement than does the stature of children. Most of the evidence of secular increase in adult stature has been derived from men, and there may be a sex difference.      {PARAG} McCance (1966) notes that "Males are more vulnerable [to undernutrition in early life] than females in some and possibly all species and rehabilitate less completely." Acheson and Fowler (1964) considered that "Boys are more readily influenced by environmental factors than are girls, both as to their rate of skeletal maturation and to their linear growth." Bakwin and McLaughlin (1964) found that male Harvard entrants from public schools (Americanstyle) had increased in average height, but not those from private schools; but female entrants to Wellesley showed no change in either group. It may be noted that, by contrast with these highly selected American groups, the Aberdeen mothers cannot in general be considered as having grown up in an optimum or near-optimum environment.

ABSTRACT: In the long-running debate over standards of living during the industrial revolution,pessimists have identified deteriorating health conditions in towns as undermining the positive effects of rising real incomes on the ‘biological standard of living’. This article reviews long-run historical relationships between urbanization and epidemiological trends in England, and then addresses the specific question: did mortality rise especially in rapidly growing industrial and manufacturing towns in the period c. 1830–50?  Using comparative data for British, European, and American cities and selected rural populations, this study finds good evidence for widespread increases in mortality in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. However, this phenomenon was not confined to ‘new’ or industrial towns. Instead, mortality rose in the 1830s especially among young children (aged one to four years) in a wide range of populations and environments  ...  Instead, mortality rose in the 1830s especially among young children (aged one to four years) in a wide range of populations and environments

     ... dramatic improvement in urban life expectancy after c. 1750 

p459 death rates in English cities in the mid-nineteenth century were modest by the standards of many continental European cities. This was particularly the case with respect to infant mortality, but mortality at older ages was also unexceptional. London, then the largest city in Europe, was extraordinarily salubrious compared with much smaller British and continental cities.17 However, even the unhealthiest British cities, including Liverpool, Manchester, and Glasgow, were unremarkable by continental standards.18     

p462     The deterioration in mortality after 1820 was, according to Szreter, driven in the main by a rise in mortality from ‘infectious diseases and sanitation diseases, especially at ages 3–24 months’.

p463 Here we take three new approaches to improve our understanding of urban mortality patterns in England in the first half of the nineteenth century.
       ... Taken together our findings refute the specific claims made by Szreter and Mooney, that mortality worsened particularly in fast-growing industrial and manufacturing towns and was most extreme in the decades of the 1830s and 1840s. Instead they support, and extend, Woods’s interpretation of both the trends and the causes of urban mortality patterns in this period



p467 figures -- maybe rural 120  urban therefor 180 ... 


The synchronized rise and fall of scarlet fever as a major cause of early childhood mortality between c. 1830 and c. 1870, in populations across Europe and North America, suggest very strongly that this was an autonomous biological phenomenon driven by changes in the virulence of the pathogen, albeit one that was propagated by networks of communication between international ports, and between ports and their hinterlands.


p481 the worsening of urban mortality rates in the middle decades of the nineteenth century was not confined to British industrial towns and cities. Rather it appears to have been a very widespread phenomenon that affected rural as well as urban populations.       ....     However, scarlet fever should be considered a major explanatory factor.   
Our evidence indicates that there were indeed very widespread rises especially in early childhood mortality in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, that were sustained until roughly 1870.
p482 ... (re height declines)  Our results therefore lend tentative support to arguments that childhood health and development were depressed in the mid-nineteenth century. However, it remains very unclear whether the observed hikes in childhood mortality, especially from scarlet fever, were associated with increases in chronic ill health, or represented acute events with few sequelae for survivors

    The standard of living of the working class has been a particularly contentious issue in the historiography of the industrial revolution. The classic debate centred on the first half of the nineteenth century and concerned the impact of industrialization. More recently, attention has turned to the eighteenth century: was Britain a high wage economy in the run‐up to the industrial revolution?60  ...  King, Massie, and Colquhoun ... these social observers ... In their eyes, England was definitely a high wage economy. English workers were always very well off by international standards: The average member of a working‐class family in England always got more than three subsistence baskets each year (table 5), while many Europeans, Latin Americans, and Asians were lucky to get one.61  ...  English workers did not consume three times the oatmeal specified in the subsistence diet but instead upgraded their consumption to bacon, beer, and white bread. For this reason, English men were also taller than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.62 (cite Floud, Fogel, Harris, Hong &  Restatement,)

The incomes of industrial families were, on average, higher, but they were also much more divergent       As male incomes rose, their breadwinning became more unreliable, which created new forms of inequality within families as well as between them    
The evidence is clear: industrialization ushered in a far more complex, and unequal, society than that which it replaced. It is time to abandon the optimist/pessimist framework and to develop suitably plural, historical approaches and perspectives.  
p111  Industrialization did not just raise wages, lengthen working hours, depress heights, and so on. It wrought fundamental changes in patterns of family life, human existence, and social relations. So long as male wages had provided for no more than the meanest subsistence, all members of the family were tightly bound in a nexus of needs and responsibilities; but when men were able to earn something better than a subsistence wage they — and they alone — were freed from that nexus.    changes within the family dynamic   significant for      hard economic questions.   
cultural change lay at the heart of Britain’s industrial transition, and contains the key to understanding the social distribution of the nation’s newfound wealth.

2015 Allen Restatement    -- responds to Humphries      late 18C Brits are tallest Europeans; via Cinnerella (heights) "the standard of living slipped during the second quarter of the 19th C, for the heights of the men born in that period dropped. Why this happened is not entirely clear. There are three possibil-ities.43 (Komlos: shrinking)"  decreased W via increased inequality; pollution and disease of large cities; decr rel price of manuf goods so perhaps shift away from kids food. Allen says none matter for the high-wage explanation of the Ind Rev  

      p13. The economic implications of declining heights came in the later Victorian period. The British workforce of the 1880s and 1890s was shorter than the workforce of the 1780s and 1790s. Perhaps intellectual development was also adversely affected. The decline in the quality of the work- force may have contributed to Britain’s poor productivity performance in the late nineteenth century.          ...  At the end of the eighteenth century, the geographical distribution of these attributes was not dissimilar to that  of height.45 The highest levels of literacy and numeracy were reached in Britain, the US, and the Low Countries. They were followed by north-eastern France, western Germany, and Scandinavia.                         ....   Wages, height, and literacy point to an important conclusion: the quality of childhood in eighteenth-century Britain was high in comparison to that in most other parts of the world.
 V   Underlying all of her criticisms of the high wage economy is Humphries’s view that living standards for many people were low during the industrial revolution
   p18   "The ‘standard of living question’ was the result of the liquidation of the traditional sectors that were responsible for the prosperity of the eighteenth century. The standard of living problem was big because these sectors were large.55"    16th 17th C L family could not afford "respectable" standard of living   "The situation changed between 1700 and 1775 due to the rise in spinners’ wages. In this ‘golden age’ the family earned 20 per cent more than necessary to purchase the respectability standard."   p19  but figure 6 shows how the general prosperity of the high wage economy of the eighteenth century gave way to enormous inequality as the industrial revolution unfolded. " FIG 6 shows Agric L incomes mostly the same 1770-1860 (but variable, some jumps, 1845-55?) INCREASED INEQUALITY   VI  English working class ate bread, cheese, meat (as described by Engels?) BEER?

"Lure ... Patriarchal Perspective ... " -- promising for us, for pregnant woman's caloric needs (but what of the "just buy oatmeal" alternative? )     
p695  The main criticism presented in this article  ...  begins with the claim that wages at the end of the eighteenth century were historically high and provided a living standard ‘far above bare bones subsistence’
   706  Moreover, there is good evidence to suggest that infant and  childhood mortality deteriorated in the first half of the nineteenth century, meaning that families faced the costs of bearing and at least partially raising children only to have them die before adulthood with greater frequency.55

  We revise previous estimates on average nutritional status in Britain during the industrial revolution. We find that average nutritional status declined substantially throughout the period 1740–1865, with a partial recovery only for the cohorts born in 1805–9 and 1810–14. The decline in nutritional status estimated for the second half of the eighteenth century is consistent with recent estimates of food prices and farm labour wages. We suggest that parliamentary enclosures and the decline of cottage industry could partially explain the fall in nutritional status. In addition, comparing the age at final attainment of height of a group of rural residents with a group of urban migrants we provide further evidence about the negative impact of urbanization during the early industrial revolution.

The evidence here suggests that the gains for building workers were a much more substantial 82 percent. As before with Phelps Brown and Hopkins, the reason for my much greater optimism is almost entirely that my estimated cost of living rises much less than Feinstein’s. It was not till the 1820s that real wages advanced beyond their level in the middle of the eighteenth century   p1319 Only in the 1820s did real wages begin showing robust growth. Between then and the 1860s, real-wage growth averaged 0.9 percent per year     p1320  But, nevertheless, Irish real wages rose because of the declining prices of cloth, candles, fuel, sugar, and tea

2004 Steckel "Based on a modest sample of skeletons from northern Europe, average heights fell from 173.4 centimeters in the early Middle Ages to a low of roughly 167 centimeters during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Taking the data at face value, this decline of approximately 6.4 centimeters substantially exceeds any prolonged downturns found during industrialization in several countries that have been studied. Significantly, recovery to levels achieved in the early Middle Ages was not attained until the early twentieth century.   ...   it is plausible to link the reversal of the long-term height decline with dietary improvements."

Hobsbawm (1957 EHR 46-)    
p46 The debate about the standard of living under early industrialism has now continued for some thirty years.Among academic historians, in  Britain at any rate, the pendulum has swung away from the classical  view, held by enquirers and historians of all political views2 until the appear-ance of Clapham's *Economic History of Modern Britain*.  It is today heterodox to  believe that early industrialization was a catastrophe for the labouring poor of  this or other countries, let alone that their standard of living declined.
p60    It is altogether likely that living-standards improved over much of the 18th C. It is not improbable that soon after the onset of the Ind Rev ... [p61] they ceased to improved and declined. Perhaps the middle 1790s ... mark a turning-point. At the other end, the middle 1840's certainly mark a turning-point 
   sum up as follows. The classical view has been put in Sidney Webb's words: 2 'If the Chartists in 1837 had called for a comparison of their time with 1787, and had obtained a fair account of the actual social life of the working-man at the two periods, it is almost certain that they would have recorded a positive decline in the standard of life of large classes of the population.'

Webb (1897)    
p2 If the Chartists, in 1837, had called for a comparison of their time with 1787, and had obtained a fair account of the actual social life of the ordinary working man at the two periods, it is almost certain that they would have recorded a positive de-[p4]cline in the standard of life of large classes of the population. 
 "And ... a trustworthy comparison of [1787] with 1737  ... [would show] a smilar decline. There seems reason to believe, indeed, that in 1837 some large sections of the 'dim inarticulate multitude' were struggling in the trough of a century's decline in all that makes life worth living." 
p6   1837 marks almost the lowest depth of degradation of the English rural population, and a very low level indeed in the condition of the miner and the mill operative.
p7 In comparing ourselves with 1837 we set an appallingly low standard, 

p16 It will not, I think, be generally disputed that the last sixty years have seen a very great advance in the condition of a very large part of the people. But it is essential to notice the fact that this great advance in prosperity, this great rise in the standard of life, has not been universal. There are living in our midst to-day considerable masses of people who, as regards their economic circumstances, are still in 1837.    
p17   Mr. Charles Booth ...  some 32 per cent of the whole four millions of London's population fall within his four classes of “poverty,” earning not more than a guinea per week per family. It is difficult to believe that, even in 1837, the percentage of persons at a corresponding low [p18] level can have been greater.   ...   out of this huge residuum nearly a third are actually below what can be called even full subsistence for a London family, we shall begin to feel that our boasted progress since 1837 has not, after all, taken us very far.     
p21 Out of the four millions of women who are working for wages at the present time, a very large percentage must be earning practically no better subsistence than their grandmothers did.

Can we link higher SR2 to rural-ness?  Maybe industrial areas of Wales are blighted in 1841? [BBC site on Wales](https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/guide/ch15_industrial_revolution.shtml) identify      It was north-east Wales which developed the greatest range of industries. By the late 18th century there were 19 metalworks at Holywell and 14 potteries at Buckley; Holywell and Mold had cotton mills; lead and coal mines proliferated. Bersham, where the Wilkinson family were pioneers in the use of coke rather than charcoal in the smelting of iron, was one of Europe's leading ironworks.      
In the long term, however, the developments in the south east were more important. The ironworks of Merthyr Tydfil [a borough of Glamorgan] - Cyfarthfa and Dowlais in particular - gave rise to Wales's first industrial town. By 1830 Monmouthshire and east Glamorgan were producing half the iron exported by Britain.

ABS The malign contribution of northern industrial cities to the stagnation of national life expectancy over the period 1820–1870 forms part of one of the most long-running debates in English economic history, regarding the impact of early industrialisation on living standards.   ...   We conclude (1) that any worsening of water quality in urban areas c.1800–1850 was not confined to new or rapidly growing industrial or manufacturing towns; and (2) infants probably rarely drank untreated water, so high infant or diarrhoeal mortality rates should not be read as indicators of poor water quality, in the English context.
  ATTACK SZRETER  
  life expectancy improved at the aggregate national level between 1750 and 1820, and survival rates of infants and young children rose dramatically in London and probablyin other urban centres over the same period (Davenport,2015; Landers,1993, Chapters4–5; Wrigley, Davies, Oeppen, & Schofield,1997, p. 272)    Using a mixture of scant empirical evidence and extrapolation, Szreter and Mooney(1998) argued influentially that life expectancy fell in the national population between1820 and 1840 as a consequence of worsening conditions especially in northern indus-trial and manufacturing cities (Figure 1). 
  BUT   The higher infant and child mortality rates evident in the second half of the nineteenth century in many northern towns was probably also a feature of the first half of the century, as Szreter and Mooney argued. However it seems unlikely that this excess mortality was due to inferior water quality

  parish was chosen as a case study  ONE PARISH -- too narrow (but support OPTIMs)
By the 1860s, however, infant mortality rates in London had decreased dramatically (Landers, 1990; Schellekens, 2001), although the estimated mortality rates and the magnitude of decline in mortality over this period vary according to the method of calculation (Woods, 2006). The relative mortality of male and female infants is poorly documented in London during this important period of demographic and economic transition.
   Male infants have an inherent biological susceptibility to mortality at all ages compared with females, but this is particularly pronounced in early life. This underlying pattern of mortality, however, may be significantly influenced by infant feeding, weaning and health care behaviours for male and female infants, practices that are often socially and culturally determined (Waldron, 1983, 1987).
p117 marked decline in endogenous infant mortality, reflecting conditions
already present at birth,   Contrastingly, the reduction in total infant mortality was particularly steep between the 1790s and 1830s, despite the fact that this was a period of economic decline in the parish of Christ Church Spitalfield     ...  A plausible interpretation for these
results is that exclusive breast-feeding until the age of 3 months was widely practised in the 1830s resulting in substantially lower infant mortality in the first 3 months of life than in earlier periods. 

2008 Gregory (annals) on IMR   1870s or 1880s for urban IMR declines; rural declines earlier; rural periphery IMR decline latest?

Figure 1 shows mort decline at end 19thC .  Complicated geographic decomposition, using maps ... p791 confirms the basic snapshot pattern: Urban areas had high rates and rural areas had lower ones.   there is much to support the well-established urban story. Urban areas did indeed have high rates, they generally started to decline in the 1870s or 1880s   Urban areas   improvements were around the same as the national aggregate.   over much of the countryside, infant mortality decline started well [p792] before the 1870s  ...    This means that to understand the functioning of  the national aggregate, we must understand at least  three stories: the urban story of high rates that start  to decline in the 1870s and 1880s, the rural-core story of much larger declines starting much earlier, and the  rural-periphery story of the areas that lagged behind the  others. Within these there will clearly be many variations ...

 Huck's research  suggests that by the 1840s several of these towns were exhibiting infant  mortality rates of 200 or more per 1,000 live births, a figure which is consistent with life expectancy at birth values of little more than 30  years.4
   Wrigley, in comparing the  Cambridge Group's parish register reconstitution results with Woods's  work and with the official civil register data for the period after the  1830s, has concurred that there was a 'striking change' in the nation's  mortality regime across the 1 830s.5

 The evidence presented here indicates that, notwithstanding probable rises in male real wage rates, during the second quarter of the nineteenth century there was a serious deterioration in the standard of  living of the growing proportion of the population recruited into the  urban industrial workforce; and furthermore that this trend of deterioration, although halted in the late 1850s and 1860s, was not significantly  reversed until as late as the 1870s and 1880s.

Pre-famine Ireland:  consensus that it was poor but healthy (taller than English -- but all might be pretty short?).   
*IMR* is an unsettled issue (JRI not aware of others). Mokyr suggest 224 per K, and others suggest IMR above other Europeans. But the SR1 is inconsistent with that sort of IMR, absent mortal female-gender bias. E.g. suppose 25% infant mortality, male IMR 120% of female (for probabilities of death 272 and 227 per K), and SRB of 1.05: the SR of exact 1-yr-olds is 100.6; SR1 would be greater, because the M/F ratio is decreasing over the 0-12 month. For example, in a population with constant 25% infant mortality over the interval, SR1 would be about 103; with 2/3 of deaths in the first 3 months, SR1 moves down toward 102). Maybe IMR of 150 generates exact Yr1 SR of 102.6 so SR1 values of 103.5 would be reasonable ...

2007 OGrada overview essay in book from 2003 conference (Eh.net)   
    
     Ireland was a poor country in 1845, income per head being about half that in the rest of the United Kingdom. The regional contrast between the northeast, which was undergoing rapid industrialization at this time, and the west and the south was marked. Moreover, while there were some signs of a rise in urban and middleclass living standards, the half-century or so before the famine was aperiod of increasing impoverishment for the landless poor (Mokyr and O Grada, 1988).   ...  The nutritional content of the potato and widespread access to heating fuel in the form of turf eased  eased somewhat the poverty of Ireland's three million ‘potato people’, who were healthier and lived longer than the poor in other parts of Europe at the time. One indication of this, based on evidence from military and prison archives, is that adult Irish males from the lower end of the socio-economic scale on the eve of the famine were at least as tall as, if not taller than, their English peers (O Grada, 1991; Mokyr and O Grada, 1996). However, their poverty meant that when the potato failed, there was no trading down to a cheaper alternative food (O Grada, 1994a: 80~97).   
p55 conclusion notes "Several issues require further investigation" ... pre-famine well-being not among those. 

2004 Deborah Oxley (2004 SSH)  p279 Ulster's height advantage 
the devlopment gradient .. Ulster was the most developed, followed by Leinster and then Munster, while Connaught wasthe poorest. Deaths by starvation -- both absolute and relative to population size -- were exactly the inverse of this gradient ... (OGrada & ORourke 1997; Kennnedy et al. 1999:36-41)  Arguably, mortality was driven not by the crisis of a sudden crop failure, but by an ongoing level of destitution and enduring hardship that weakened resistance (Ô Grâda 1995: 3).


1997 Nicholas & Steckel -- JEEH publishes their 1992 NBER paper (tall but poor -- but covering 1785-1815, which they connect to M&OG?)

1996 Mokyr & OGrada (1996 EEH) p160 Yet on this evidence, it would be difficult to reject the claim that the Irish poor born between the 1780s and the 1840s were at least as tall as the English. Table 6 shows that Scottish workers were taller than either Irish or English (confirming the findings of Floud et al., 1990, pp. 202–209).  p161 m. The data fail to reveal any sustained improvement in observed height from the end of the Napoleonic Wars (birth cohorts of about 1790–1800) to the end of the 1850s (birth cohort of about 1835–1840). p163 All research thus far has pointed to a significant gap between Ireland and England in favor of the Irish, a gap that declines from the mid-18th century to the Famine. Furthermore, the Scots were generally taller than either the Irish or the English. It is reassuring here to find convict, military, and admiralty records all pointing in the same direction. Other information, too, suggests that the pre-Famine Irish were relatively tall and well fed (e.g., O´ Gra´da, 1992). We have also been able to establish that the unhealthy effects of cities seem to translate into the somewhat lower height of urban recruits, t p164 These differences prompt a final methodological reflection. The sensitivity in outcomes to the welfare measure used is partly resolved by the distinction between living standards and nutritional status. It is sometimes assumed that they are positively correlated—but the evidence suggests that this correlation is a loose one.

1996 OGrada (1996 Histoire Mesure)    p148 results indicated that Irish poverty was mitigated by a nutritious diet. p160 All work so far has pointed to a gap between Ireland and England in favour of the Irish, a gap that declines from the mid-eighteenth century to the Famine. Again, Scots were generally taller than either the Irish and the English. Even here there is cause for caution. The Irish pre-famine advantage may stem partly - and paradoxically - from the relative poverty of Ireland, since this would have induced a relatively better quality Irish recruit. While the Irish height advantage is striking and probably genuine - it survives cross-tabulations by occupation and region - these limitations of inferences based on volunteer army data must be borne in mind. In the circumstances, it is reassuring (and important) to find convict, military, and admiralty records all pointing in the same direction. Other information, too, suggests that the **pre-Famine Irish were relatively tall and well-fed**     p161 omes. The dependence on the potato and other low-value but high-calorie foods in poorer countries, and often accidental relationship between desirable and wholesome diets create lots of problems for those who would infer living standards from nutritional status alone

1994 Riggs Scotland prison -- Irish tall, but getting shorter in the 1820s 1830s


1993/1988 OGrada book ([Ireland Before and After the Famine](https://archive.org/details/irelandbeforeaft00ogra/page/n5/mode/2up)) p46 "argue tentatively in favour of 'light' child mortality" 
p6 In Erris as elsewhere, increasing population undoubtedly produced greater mass poverty.
p8 quotes Mokyr      one plausible reading of the map is that the adjustment was most radical where it was least needed. In this scenario, as explained by Joel Mokyr, "population grew unrestrained, continuously exacerbating poverty, thus making resolution of the problem by a catastrophe ultimately inevitable" n19 p43 of WhyIreSt But that is Mokyr describing test outcome 2 (Y/L falls with R/L but population is nonresponsive to income)



1989 OGrada p38 In the end, whether due to overpopulation or other factors, there is no denying the gradual decline in the living standards of the poor, the bottom half or so of the population before 1845.26 The shock of Phythophthora infestans would have had less of an impact in an economy with a larger margin to spare. (referring to M&OG 1988 EHR)

1988 Mokyr & OGrada EHR,  "Poor and Getting Poorer? Living Standards in Ireland before the Famine"  p211 The Irish poor almost certainly grew poorer during the half century or so before the Famine, but overall average incomes  probably rose. This implies a sharpening of the inequality of income distribution. (end of intro) **Irish GDP** shows increasing pcGDP (average)    p212 1/2 or more are poor.    "what proportion was considered 'poor'?  / A lower bound of three out of over eight million would include those who relied almost exclusively on the potato for food, ...  Other sources indicate a higher proportion  ... upper bound of 60 per cent or more could be defended ...  1841 census division of families into those 'depending on their own manual  labour', those who depended on 'the direction of labour', and those with 'vested means, professions, etc.'. In the country as a whole, the first category  accounted for 62.9 per cent of the total.'2 A safe middle ground would be  the lower half of the income distribution. p213 Table 1 "subjective impoverishment index"  -- (p. 211: responding to questionnaire "Is the general condition of the poorer classes in your parish improved, deteriorated, or stationary, since the peace, (1815))  p215  The results indicate a definite perceived deterioration of the condition of the poorer classes between I8I5 and i835.    p217 province of Connacht "the poorest and most backward" no tea dealers  p221  For consumers of tea, sugar, and tobacco, a net improvement in living standards was taking place.  p222  these proxies indicate that in the longer run improvement was neither  ubiquitous nor steady; the positive trend in tea, sugar, and tobacco consumption conceals long stretches of stagnation and decline, and growing inequality. Yet ironically, in the decade and a half before the Great Famine, still viewed by many as a Malthusian disaster, there is little evidence of severe pressure on living standards, as per caput consumption of tobacco shows an impressive recovery.     p223  A look at schooling and literacy patterns across the country and over time  should therefore provide us with another rough guide to the changes in  living standards p224  a slight rise of school enrolments  p225  The proportion illiterate is one-third higher for the 66-75 age bracket  than the I6-25 bracket. The difference is consistent with a gradual  improvement in literacy levels between the I780s and the i830s. p226  In sum, Ireland was something of an 'impoverished sophisticate', in the  sense that its literacy level was probably higher than its income level would  indicate.50 (Sandberg -- Sweden)  p228 it seems that, rising real wages in Britain notwithstanding, the 'backward' Irish economy did not fall behind in  nutritional status and that there was no substantial difficulty in feeding a  rapidly growing population in Ireland     ...   Nonetheless, the seemingly paradoxical finding that the Irish were as tall  as any other European nation and were possibly growing taller themselves  in a period of economic decline suggests three important points to be kept  in mind by those making use of physical indicators of living standards.  p229  The  much-feared Malthusian spectre was not much visible before i845.    life expectancy at birth of about 38 years, 40 years in contemporary England.62=Boyle & OGrada      Given that Irish infant mortality rates were about 50 per cent higher than in Britain, life expectancy at higher ages was very similar to that in Britain. Estimates of life expectancy at birth elsewhere in Europe are scarce, but we suspect that despite their poverty the Irish lived longer than the European norm.63   p230 In the years before the Famine the Irish were becoming more literate, and were probably growing taller, and they consumed somewhat larger quantities per head of desirable exotic  commodities on the market.   ... In terms of resilience to disasters, the British (p231)  economy was much stronger than the Irish;  ...  the classic pessimist case has insisted instead on a rising inequality which prevented the living standards of the 'poor' or the 'working class' from rising much. The re-integration of Ireland into the economic history of the United Kingdom does not clinch that traditional pessimist case, but it lends it some support

    The 1841 Census Commissioners noted the extensive age-heaping in the recorded figures (Lee 1968:289) and produced their own smoothed age distribution (Great Britain 1843:488-489) ... No indication of how these smoothed or "real" numbers were obtained was given, though it seems a graphical procedure was used. ... For ages 0-10, we used the smoothed age distribution produced by the (p546) Census Commissioners, ... [Wrigley & Schofield 1981 undercount of 0-4 age in 1841 census GB] Several authors, notably Tucker (1970), have also commented on the serious undercounting of children in the 0-2 age group in the 1841 Irish census.  The "real" figures prepared by the Census Commissioners correct for this. These figures are used in our analysis, "  
    
B&OG Table 2 reports "raw" and "smoothed" by age for males; their raw value (103479) is the sum of the male populations at ages 1month through 11months, reported census p488. The "smoothed" value (142481) for age 0 is 37.7% larger than the census value, and their age-1 value is 59.8% larger; their age 2 value is the same as that of the census (and older ages differ via smoothing).

For undercounting of children, Lee refers to Drake 309n4 and Lee says "The Census Commissioners themselves noted the probable under-recording of children." But Drake only notes the data could be flawed; Lee doesn't tell us where the commissioners noted under-recording ... The B&OG Working paper cites Tucker 1970 for undercounting  Irish Fertility Rates before the Famine  
    
p561 infant mortality 1821-41 male 172.9 female 135.2 (male rate 127% of female!)

Census page xlv+ discuss ages and the problem of age-heaping, but they are talking about ages like 20 25 30 35  The census pages cited (488-489) are Table VI, giving pop by month to month 12, then by each year of age from 2-years old. T**those are raw, given the pronounced age heaping.**  91page lxxxiii has the census "actual" which is the smoothed series -- But   . The monthly data are not smoothed.    

NOTE that the working paper version (Boyle & OGrada 1983) has the life tables they come up with.   Boyle & Grada (1983) Working Paper -- see the 1986 Demography paper

Tucker 1970 argues for massive undercount of kids at ages 0 and 1 (and B&OG present numbers that greatly inflate those values, but I can't figure out where they got the inflated values -- they attribute the smoothing to the commissioners, but the commissioners data don't bump up the count of under twos.)

Lee 1968:289  -- is about age heaping (not about monthly stuff).

Mokyr 1983:9  says 

     Kane (1845, pp. 400-1) reported that the average height of the Irish was 70 inches, compared to 68 5 inches for the English and 68 inches for the Belgians.    
But reading Kane, we see that he was not saying typical Irish were taller, but referring to University of Edinburgh students -- well-fed people.  p400 "when at all well fed, there is no race more perfectly developed as to physical conformation, than the inhabitants of this island." His discussion comes after saying p397 "That human labour can be obtained in this country on lower terms than almost any other in Europe, is too well known to require example.  ...  this nominal cheapness is, however, by no means necessarily economy in the final cost. A wretched man who can earn, by his exertion, but 4s or 5s a week, ... must be so ill fed, and depressed in mind, that to work, as a man should work, is beyond his power. Hence there are often seen about employments in this country a number of hands, double what would be required to do the same work, in the same time, with British labourers.

p48   land appears to have been less of a binding constraint on the Irish economy than the "overpopulation" view would have us believe. 
p53 The crude Malthusian model which sets population change as a function of economic variables is wholly inappropriate

Mokyr & OGrada (EEH 1982) cite Mokyr's IMR of 220 "50% higher than England, France, the Low Countries of Scandinavia" pretty pessimistic view, albeit some attention to "relatively well fed and healthy, though poorly clothed and housed" "leisure and children represented forms of consumption" ... but "in the first half of the 19th C there was little economic progress in Ireland"   Note they cite Mokyr as 1982 forthcoming --

Lee (1968 EHR) "Marriage and population in pre-famine Ireland" attacks Drake's (1963) take on the 1841 census and Connell's work. Important for us is pessimist view of Irish diet and health (implicitly) in the 1830s ...    

     p291 IV That the fertility of Irish wives in the i830's was much the same as among the  older-marrying Norwegians is puzzling.5 Dr Drake recognizes that this may be  simply due to faulty Irish statistics,6 {6 Ibid=Drake p. 309, n. i. The Census Commissioners themselves noted the probable under-recording of children.} but the problem nevertheless warrants a reconsideration of the nutritional value of the potato. Dr Connell's conclusion that  the diet was more than adequate assumes a daily per capita consumption of 10 lb.  of potatoes and one pint of milk. It does not take into account the two "meal  months" between the old and the new potatoes, when the labourer lived in a  state of semi-starvation, nor does it make any allowance for the worsening of the  quality of the potatoes, the watery lumper having replaced better types in the  labourers' diet by 1815. The per capita consumption of milk almost certainly de-clined in the half-century before the Famine, when the pig displaced the cow as  the cottiers' most prized possession.  It seems likely that fertility in the 1830's,  when local potato failure was endemic, and the quality of the diet at its worst were lower than a generation or two earlier.

The decline of mortality between 1870 and 1914 was widespread in large cities across the North Atlantic economies (Costa and Kahn, 2015). The sharp reduction of mortality occurred in the U.S. (Cutler and Miller, 2005; Troesken, 1999), in Germany (Brown, 1989), and in the U.K. (Szreter, 1988) among other countries. This decline initially allowed urban mortality to reach parity with that of rural areas, which had long enjoyed a health advantage (Woods, 2003). Urban mortality then continued to fall, finally giving cities the life expectancy advantage over rural areas they currently enjoy (including in the developing world, see Bocquier et al., 2011). </p>

      Despite undeniable economic progress, child-raising conditions worsened for many French families in the second half of the 19th century (Rollet 1990, 1997). With industrialization, a growing share of the population left the countryside to swell the ranks of the urban proletariat, whose working, housing, and living conditions undermined their life expectancy. This period saw  urban mortality overtake rural mortality more than ever before. In addition, lack of time to raise their own children forced many working-class mothers to place them with nurses, which correspondingly diminished their chances of survival. This phenomenon is the main cause of the resurgence of infant mortality during the Second Empire.    ... From the late 1880s to the eve of World War II, life expectancy rose from 43 years to almost 60.  ... In particular, this was the period in which large-scale sanitation infrastructure projects were realized in the major cities—from the improvement of sewer systems to the construction of drinking-water distribution networks.

</p><p>Haines & Kintner (2000 Hi Meth) on Germany
p83 It is clear that urbanization was critical to differential mortality. In the nineteenth century, urban death rates were most often substantially higher than rural death rates because of the unfavorable effects of crowding and poor urban sanitation and housing conditions (Weber 1899, 343-67; Davis 1973; Preston and Haines 1991). For example, for Prussia in 1876177, the urban infant mortality rate was 21 percent higher than the rural rate. This differential had disappeared (and slightly reversed) by 1908-12 (Knodel 1974, 169)

And Influenza, pneumonia, and bronchitis -- usually largest contributor to mortality change --  was virtually constant.

#### Current views of the onset of Infant-Mortality Transition in the USA?

ACTUALLY VERY LITTLE HAS BEEN OFFERED (beyond citing HSUS)
<br>
Papers that use HSUS series to say IMR fell 1850 to 1900:
Alsan & Goldin (2019) p587 rely on HSUS to say "From 1870 to 1930 ... infant mortality plummeted from around one in five to one in 16 white infants for the United States and Massachusetts" 
Cain & Paterson (2012 Children of Eve) p.73


Papers saying there was a late-19C Mortality decline, without attention to IMR ... 
Cain & Hong (2009) e0; Higgs (1979) late 19C mortality decline, nothing on IMR; Higgs (1973) rural mortality decline 1870-1920, nothing on IMR; Meeker (1972) Mortality transition from 1880 on, nothing on IMR.

Cutler & miller  The gradient was much steeper for infants and children. In 1880, infant mortality was 140% higher in cities, and in 1890, mortality among children aged 1-4 was 94% higher (Haines 2001; U.S. Census Office 1888).
</p>

<p>For citations for view that "mortality was declining in the 2nd 1/2 of 19th C" then we'll include Higgs (1979 EEH) who focusses on timing of "when the death rate began its long-term decline."  </p>

<br>
p48 However, the new American Medical Association made an important contribution by examining conditions of the larger American cities. In 1848, it reported that disease was as prevalent in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia as in London, Manchester, and Glasgow, and that the death rates were even higher in the American cities. These revelations, plus the example of Massachusetts, prompted six additional States to enact registration laws by 1851, though for the most part the laws were ineffective and unenforced.

<br>p57 In 1880, the Bureau of the Census established a national ‘‘registration area’’ for deaths. This original area consisted of only two States—Massachusetts and New Jersey—the District of Columbia, and several large cities having efficient systems for the registration of deaths, but by 1900 eight other States had been admitted. For the years 1880, 1890, and 1900, mortality data were received from the States and cities included in this expanding area, but birth and death figures for the entire country were still compiled from the reports of census enumerators.
The annual collection of mortality statistics for the registration area began with the calendar year 1900

     Recent work with the genealogical data has concluded that adult mortality was relatively stable after about 1800 and then rose in the 1840s and 1850s before commencing long and slow improvement after the Civil War.  This finding is surprising because we have evidence of rising real income per capita and of significant economic growth during the 1840–1860 period. ... (p 1-386) Rural mortality probably began its decline in the 1870s because of improvements in diet, nutrition, housing, and other quality-of-life aspects on the farm. ... Urban mortality probably did not begin to decline prior to 1880, but thereafter urban public health measures – especially construction of central water distribution systems to deliver pure water and sanitary sewers – were important in producing a rapid decline of infectious diseases and mortality in the cities that installed these improvements (Melosi 2000). There is no doubt that mortality declined dramatically in both rural and urban areas after about 1900 (Preston and Haines 1991).    ...   Following the Civil War, the disease environment improved in what might be called an “epidemiological transition.”  ...  (1-387) ... It is clear that, before about 1920, urban mortality was much in excess of rural mortality and, in general, the larger the city, the higher the death rate (Haines 2001).   ... (1-388)  For young children (ages 1–4 years) the ratios were much higher, with urban mortality being 107 percent higher in 1890 and 97 percent higher in 1900. For infants the excess urban mortality was 63 percent in 1890 and 49 percent in 1900. ... (1-389) ... Overall, the mortality transition in the United States was a delayed event  ... . Indeed, an increase in mortality was evident prior to the Civil War. The sustained decline commenced nationally only in the 1870s. A damping of year-to-year mortality fluctuations also took place after midcentury.  ... By the later nineteenth century, public health certainly contributed much, with improvements in diet, housing, and standard of living also being significant.

Oddly, the Massachusetts IMR series shows a fairly clear climb from ~120 in 1857/59 to 150 and higher in the 1870s. Then stable around ~160 from 1870 to 1896, when it declines fairly steadily (153 in 1900, 130 1910, 90 in 1920, 60 in 1930, 25 in 1950). <br>
From that IMR data, predict 1860 SR2 not achieved again until betwen 1910 and 1920. We find?

<br>p65 Because most small cities made only modest attempts at public health initiatives before 1900 (Duffy 1990, chap. 12), it is much less certain if infant and childhood mortality fell relative to adult mortality for the nation as a whole between 1850 and 1900, which Haines’s model predicts.   
<br> Figures 6, 7, and 8 compare some of the new life table estimates with Haines’s (1998) life table estimates. ... the new life tables describe a decline in life expectancy at birth from approximately 44 years in the late eighteenth century to just over 40 years in the 1840s. ...  Life expectancy at birth then declined another 3–4 years in the 1850s to approximately 37 years. The decline is largely the result of the model’s prediction of increased infant mortality.  ...  the model suggests that infant mortality rates rose from 215 to 247 per 1,000 for white males and from 190 to 222 for white females

<br>p74 Table 9 seems to be an error ... 
<br>p76  ... the crude assump-tions about the overestimation of adult life expectancy in genealogical-based estimates and sex differentials in adult life expectancy made in tables 4 and 5 are sources of po-tential error. Another weakness is the required method of inferring a complete life table from a single parameter, life expectancy at age 20. Historical demographers in Europe and elsewhere have called attention to the changing relation-ship between infant, childhood, and adult mortality over the course of the nineteenth century (Woods 1993). It is unlikely that the United States was an exception. Empirical research on infant and childhood mortality in the United States is sorely needed. Source material, however, remains a major issue.

Haines [(2001 Annals Demog)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q0l6vqaohlubi0a/Haines2001AnnDemog.pdf?dl=0) "The urban mortality transition in the United States, 1800–1940" 
<br>p33 In the United States in the XIXth century, as in Europe in that era, there was a substantial mortality “penalty” to living in urban places (e.g., Williamson, 1982, 1990, ch. 9; Davis, 1973; Weber, 1899, ch 6; Brown, 1991; Vögele, 1994). By 1940, that urban penalty had  been largely eliminated; and it was healthier, in many cases, to reside in a city than in the countryside. Part of the study of the great mortality transition in the United States is related to this phenomenon.    
<br>A significant problem with the history of mortality in the United States stems from the paucity of good statistical information—on levels, trends, and differentials. It is possible, however, using a variety of sources and demographic estimation methods, partially to reconstruct the course of mortality in the United States from 1800 onwards and, more particularly, to provide some insight into differentials. When census data, vital statistics, local records, and genealogical data are culled for what they can reveal, the outlines appear.   
<br>p34 In the early XIXth century, the U S was a relatively low mortality region by the standards of Western Europe. Since it was not particularly urban (only 6.1% in 1800), a crude death rate in the range of 20-25 per 1,000 population would not have been unusual. 
  ... Mortality was likely lowest in New England and rose as the latitude moved further south. Such evidence as we have (mostly for New England the Middle Atlantic states) does indicate a substantial urban penalty ... 1900 within Death Reg Area (six New England states (MASS, CT, VT, ME, NH, RI), NY, PA, MI, IN, DC)   URB PENALTY 1900 IPUMS-based suggest

   cites Condran/Crimmins for 1890s penalty falling; urb pen from TB, diarheal, other infectious/communcial
     
<br>p35 For the seven states with reasonable registration data in both 1890 and 1900, the ratio of urban to rural overall CDR ... in 1890 census 1.32 ... 1.17 in 1900 (See Table 2). Concernig the death rates for young children (aged 1-4) the ratios were much higher, with urban mortality being 94% higher in 1890 and 100% higher in 1900. For infants the excess urban mortality was 88% in 1890 and 48% in 1900.    ... The rural urban differential seems to have been true earlier as well. For seven New York counties in 1865, the probability of dying before reaching age five was .229 in urban areas but .192 in rural locations (Haines, 1977).   
NOTICE: small differential of 1865 -- we should consider 1890 ...
<br>p36 Given the paucity of vital statistics data in the XIXth century, it is difficult to describe the process of the mortality transition. One place to start is with city vital registration.  ... One must conclude that large American cities had become virtual charnel houses by the middle of the XIXth century and that this contributed notably to the rising mortality in the United States before the American Civil War. 

BTW 1890 and 1900 census volumes show fairly benign SR5 values, 

<br>p41 The rural advantage seems simply to have been that rural residents were farther from each other, reducing chances of contagion and contamination of water supplies.  ...  Also, the XXth century mortality decline was significantly propelled by the elimination of excess urban deaths (Preston
and Haines, 1991, 36-39; Taeuber and Taeuber, 1958, 274-275).
<br> P&H 36-39 is on rural mort advantage;

<br>Alter (1997) "Signs of falling infant mortality become widespread after 1890"  --  
p 104 After 1860 the evidence suggests a period of stability before the mortality transition began. The timing of this transition seems to have varied and may have been somewhat earlier in major cities, where concern about high levels of infant mortality was growing. It is also possible that child mortality declined two of three decades earlier than infant mortality (see the discussion of Table 6.3 above). Signs of falling infant mortality become widespread after 1890, and infant mortality was cut in half between 1900 and 1930.
<br> p105 Gretchen Condran has argued that we should move ‘away from the notion of a single mortality transition to a view that many transitions varying in timing and pace, were occurring both in different places and for various causes of death’ (Condran, 1987: 131). This broader perspective helps to explain why studies which focus on public health often fail to find clear associations between specific interventions and lower mortality. The relatively high standard of living in the United States and Canada tends to draw attention away from explanation based upon economic development and toward a diversity of environmental and behavioural factors.

<p>Preston & Haines (1991) *Fatal Years* [detailed coverage](SSMMfatalYears.html);
[in Jim's DL](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fk0yglszu300s1u/Preston%26Haines1991FatalYears.pdf?dl=0) </p>
<p>Points for CEA paper: p74 their 5q0 is 180/k (falling from 204, I'd say) and that reflects IMR (123, falling from 137) and 1q4 (66, falling from 78). So they have about 10% fall in infant & child mortality. And with a 1-level change in West, that's +2.5 yrs to female e0 
If we eliminate the q0 fall, the 0q5 fall is about 1/2 as much; e0 effect, also about 1/2 as much ... Or maybe they have an estimate of 5q0 and since q0 is not falling, their estimate implies a 20% drop in 4q0?

     "The grand mean is approximately a level of 13.5 for 1895. At this level of mortality in the West model life table system, q(5) is .180 and the implied expectation of life at birth is 49.8 years.
     
West model 
level 13 IMR 130 1q4 72   0q5 192  with 1q4 60: 182.3 
level 14 IMR 116 1q4 60   0q5 169  with 1q4 72: 179.3 

... without IMR decline? avg Lev13 192 and 179  (not 169)   ... suggest 185  not 180 ...  

</p><p>It's hard to pin down the change of IMR. Model LT level change 1.1:
IMR change per level averages 14.3 so 1.1 levels implies IMR falls 15.7 (almost 16, eg 125 to 109).
<br>Prob of death 0-5 = q0 + 1q4 x (1-q0)   Level 13.5 is 180.7  Level 13.68 should be 176.6 ...  0.32 * 192.3  + 0.68 * 169.2  = 
</p>
<p>Consider 1-level change in West, from 12 to 13, or 13 to 14 : the IMRs are 144, 130, 116; seems like the IMR change is about 22 (like 144 to 122)

<br>That is a stretch, for their data show improvement from 1885.

Therefore we are inclined to disregard age-model estimates of q(1) and q(2). ... To derive a single best estimate of child mortality conditions in the United States near the turn of the century. we amalagamated the q(3), q(5), and q(10) estimates from the three different estimation procedures.  *The estimate of a q(5) of .180 for 1895 is probably the single most robust estimate* of childhood mortality that we can make based on the census sample</p>

<br>p381 Demographic historians agree that a mortality transition was occurring in the United States during the late 19th century, but they disagree over the nature of that transition. There is no consensus about when the death rate began its long-term  decline. Some scholars believe that mortality fell steadily and continuously during the entire second half of the 19th century.n1 Others maintain that relatively little if any decline occurred during the mid-19th century and that rapid decline occurred only after 1880.n2 [Higgs 1971, Meeker 1972]

<br>Leonard, Beemer, Anderton (2012 Cont & Change 433-59) p433 For the United States, the evidence suggests that overall mortality may have declined in the third and early <p434> fourth quarters of the nineteenth century.[3 Costa & Steckel 1997, Ferrie 2003 (re:1850-60), Swedlund (1990); Hautaniemi, Swedlund, Anderton] However, in Massachusetts, mortality plateaued during the latter half of the nineteenth century, and not until the turn of the twentieth century did mortality begin a slow but sustained decline.[4 HSUS - no more detail?] In previous work, we have argued that high overall regional mortality was sustained by the strains of significant population growth within newly emerging urban–industrial communities.5 These strains were ultimately relieved as population growth stabilised and urban infrastructures developed, notably with the introduction of filtered water supplies and sewage systems.6 Although such improvements began after mid-century, their widespread penetration into emerging industrial cities as not completed until near the turn of the century or later, when regional mortality finally began to fall.

p124 In the latter half of the nineteenth century, rates of infant mortality in American cities were a matter of grave
concern. As many as 15 to 20 percent of newborns died within their first year, and in the worst neighborhoods or
most afflicted cities, rates could go much higher (Phelps 1912; Woodbury 1926; Swedlund 1990; Meckel 1991).

1857 p162 Returns Incomplete
  It is a moatter of regret, that more complete records and returns have not been secured during the whole history of registration in the State, which now covers a period of more than 16 years. A grdual improvement in some particulars, has been going on, it is true , but it is very slow. Generally speaking, the returns of marriages are the most complete of the three items, and births are more fully returned than deaths -- the most important of all.
199/p179  have examined [records] of several different cities and States of teh Union, also Eng Fr Belg Sw Nr Russ Pruss Austr Sax and other foregn countries. The facts furnished us, cover upwards of one hundred million births, show 1,073 boys to every 1,000 girls born alive. Over one million of recorded births in the United States show 1,066 boys to 1,000 girls. Mass 1845-57  1,054 boys to 1,000 girls.  The proportion of sexes at birth differs in different countries as we have stated in the Tenth Report (1851).

p163   There is evidence for believing that not very far from, but, perhaps, somewhat more than fifteen per cent of the deaths that occur annually in Mass, escape registration; and these are scattered through about half of the towns in the COmmonwealth.     ... The deficiencies in the working of the law occur chiefly in the country towns, ... 

The returns from Berkshire manifest greater defects than those from any other county.

p164  returns for the present Report are as complete as those of the last year, and we are inclined to believe they are somewhat more so.  ...   Those most likely to escpate registration are the stillbirths, and perhaps those who die at extreme infancy.

p194   ....  The First Division embraces the metropolis, which, in density of population and other particulars, differs from any other section of the State.     

p195 in the metropolis, the records are at least as complete as in any other section of the State.  ... the excellent system of registry of deaths in the city of Boston, is as complete as that of foreign countries, and that it does not appreciably fall short of the actual truth.

By the time cholera had run its course in 1849, it had killed 5,071 New Yorkers. Forty percent of the dead were Irish immigrants. Cholera was a constant presence in the city through 1854, when the disease again reached epidemic proportions, killing 2,509. It then disappeared for a dozen years.

Moreover, another cholera outbreak in 1834, coming fast on the heels of the epidemic two years before, further convinced the Common Council that potable water and cleaner streets were necessary to the health of the city.

Philadelphia experienced the worst urban outbreak in the nation because the first appearance of the virus in the city coincided with a war bonds parade; the large crowds in attendance permitted the virus to infect thousands in one day, and tens of thousands within the next week. The large number of rapid deaths overwhelmed city services, with corpses languishing in apartments and mass burials the result.

<p>Condran & Cheney (1982 Demography) seem to tell us the data for IMR are no good before 1920; they estimate IMR by extrapolating on mortality of 1to4 year olds. Their age 1-4 mortality rate in 1900 is 61% of the 1870 value; the 1930 value is 25% of the 1900 value.
<br>Note that in 1930, Registration States, white male IMR is 62 and female is 50 (per 1,000).

<br>Urban mortality rates, for example, remained high for some time after rural mortality rates had begun their decline (Condran and Crimmins, 1980; Higgs, 1973; Knodel, 1977 [Knodel is on Germany])
<br> ... The trend in the crude death rates in Philadelphia from 1870 to 1930 is shown in Figure 1. ... The deaths are those reported in the annual reports of the Philadelphia Bureau of Health. Throughout the time period from 1870 to 1930, the mortality regime in Philadelphia was characterized by crude death rates which were high and fluctuating from year to year. Some of the fluctuation may have been due to the inadequacy of the extrapolated population figures or the death register, but much can probably be explained by genuine shifts in the levels of infectious disease from one year to the next. A decline in the crude death rates occurred between 1890 and 1900. The crude death rate of 23/1000 in 1892 was not surpassed again except during the influenza epidemic of 1918
<br>p98 Figure 1 death rates Chicago low by 1897; 
 highly variable, downwardish 1870-1915 (pandemic 1918)
<br>p99 Estimating lqO from 1870 to 1930 presented a special problem because of the exceptionally poor quality of both the census enumeration of infants and the birth registration data available for Philadelphia.    ... Births in Philadelphia were estimated to be approximately 30 percent underenumerat- [p100] ed in 1880, and although the exact pattern of change over time is not known, a fairly large underregistration was probably the rule for much of the time period in our analysis (Cheney, 1981). Therefore, before 1920,the 1q0 values obtained using birth registration data are certainly higher than the true 1qovalues which we are trying to estimate.  ... two other estimates of 1q0 were made by fitting C&D W and S Model Life Tables to the 4q1 values. ...  The downward shift in childhood diarrheal deaths coupled with improvements in birth registration and in the census enumeration of infants in fact produce a convergence of all four estimates of lqO in 1920 and 1930."

p4  In essence, this article argues that the tremendous catch-up growth experienced by slaves is inconsistent with Steckel’s assertion that slave birth weights, a proxy for health in utero, were incredibly low. Adaptive theories of human growth suggest that poor conditions in utero have long-lasting effects on the growth pattern of children, especially in limiting catch-up growth. Thus, it is more likely that slave children experienced relatively good conditions in utero and had higher birth weights than Steckel argued.

## Sex-Ratios and Sex-Discrimination: Testing for Excess Girl Mortality -- maybe a separate paper?

  **SR1-5 or 5-9? **^[The Indian data often does not work for SR1-based sex-discrim test. The 1891 census gives SR01 SR04 (yes, the first is part of the second) and SR59. The SR01-SR04 is mostly inconclusive, but I suspect that is because Indian SR1 is very noisy (see 1891 Appendix p. vi ([pdf 295](https://www.dropbox.com/s/18d5blekfq3wurl/India1891CensusPp247%2C295.pdf?dl=0)) ), mostly because the age-1 populations look bizarre, at just 53% the size of the age-0 populations.]   
  
Comparing a population's sex ratios in infancy and childhood (e.g. ages 1-4) offers a powerful one-sided test for extremes of gender discrimination that cause excess mortality among girls.^["extremes" because there are so many varieties of gender discrimination, and many of which would be unlikely to cause excess female mortality that would show up in population statistics] It is definitely a one-sided test, because the mere fact that the SR5 is below (or near) the SR1 does not rule out various forms of misogynstic gender-discrimination. ^[Indeed, one could imagine quite egregious patterns of discrimination against girls which would not leave a footprint in the sex-ratio evidence.]   
  (societal misogny? a term to use?)  
However, if we find a population where the SR5 is substantially greater than the SR1, we have a strong evidence of sex-discrimination that killed girls -- sex-discrimination in the form of "selective neglect" of girls, or of female infanticide more narrowly.^[The term "selective neglect" refers to "a withdrawal of care and attention ... sufficient to kill an infant or young child" (Scheper-Hughes, 1987: 14). Referring to such behavior, Lynch (2011) uses instead the term "mortal neglect", from Scheper-Hughes (1992:20,343). However, Lynch's usage does not fit well with Scheper-Hughes' concept, which is to "the mortal neglect of certain presumed-to-be-doomed babies" (1992:20). The girls who suffered from sex-selective neglect were not otherwise doomed. Indeed, recalling male infants' biological mortality disadvantage, natural mortality risks would tend to leave male babies, more than females, subject to "mortal neglect."] Absent extreme forms of misogynst gender-discrimination, the SR5 in a population will tend to be somewhat lower than the SR1, because mortality risks are "naturally" greater for boys than girls.^[Absent extremes of gender-discrimination, the sex-ratio tends to decrease with age, until women start having children. The effects will be more apparent when mortality among the young is high. Population growth would only accentuate the process of a diminishing sex-ratio with age, because population growth would tend to pump up the SR1, increasing the weight of the very young, and the very young are the most male (the effects of male-biased infant mortality showing up as age increases)]. Even allowing for well-intentioned behaviours seeking to mediate the male mortality disadvantage, it is difficult to come up with a story to generate a pattern of increasing sex-ratios with age that does not include excess female mortality from misogynisticsex-discrimination.  



Although the biological mechanisms driving sex-differences in infant mortality may be mediated by "adaptive responses" (or human agency more generally), it seems clear that biology leaves boys more vulnerable than girls to a range of diseases and hazards, so that absent sex discrimination, infant and child mortality among girls tends to be lower than among boys.    


### The Fallacy of the SR1 as a test for excess female mortality 
Recognizing a low value of the SR1 as a powerful indicator of deleterious living conditions for pregnant women and infants, it is tempting to suggest that a not-low value of the SR1 could be an indicator of gender discrimination -- if the not-low SBR is found in a population known to exist with poor living conditions and high rates of infant and fetal mortality. In a society of general material deprivation (poor nutrition, poor health, and a general lack of "the necessaries and conveniences of life"^[[Malthus 1798, Ch. 16:](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/malthus/ch16.htm) "I do not mean to enter into a philosophical discussion of what constitutes the proper happiness of man, but shall merely consider two universally acknowledged ingredients, health, and the command of the necessaries and conveniences of life.]), we expect to find the SR1 to be low -- parity perhaps. If we observe an SR1 greater than expected, we might conclude we have evidence of excess mortality of female infants. However, with a little attention to theory and evidence it becomes clear that looking for unexpectedly high SR1 values is a very weak test for excess female mortality -- a test for gender discrimination that affects relative survival prospects of girls and boys. 

Although one might be tempted to draw inferences about gender discrimination from comparisons of the SR1 (or other sex ratios for childhood), across societies and time, tests based on SR1 comparisons are weak, especially in relation to likely noise in the underlying data and uncertainties about infant mortality rates and other demographic parameters.   




#### Literature for vocab of misogynistic sex-discrimination

Lynch (2011 Hi Fam^[Lynch, K.A., 2011. Why weren’t (many) European women “missing”? Hist. Fam. 16, 250–266.]. p251 This article enters the discussion of the “missing women” question using Sen's work and the research of others on Asia to compare with evidence on the disadvantaging or even “mortal neglect” (Scheper-Hughes, 1992) of girls or the disadvantaging of women in western European society in the early modern and modern periods — roughly from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries" nineteenth centuries. Like Sen's essay, it is not concerned with “sexism” or the simple subordination of females of all ages to males. Rather, it addresses both  Rather, it addresses both the intensive disadvantaging that resulted directly in the actual deaths of females, particularly as babies or as young girls; and the disadvantaging of women later in life as evidenced by rates of mortality higher than those of men. Although the mortal neglect of babies and young girls and the disadvantaging of adolescent and mature women may appear together, they are not necessarily or inextricably intertwined. Some might argue that any kind of inequality or subordination, whether between men and women or between social classes, is bound to result in unequal chances of survival. This is doubtless true in modern settings where differential access to effective medical care can be extreme and heavy with consequences for those excluded from it. However, in historic western Europe, it is not clear that the wealthy, for example, enjoyed significantly higher life expectancies than the poor until the relatively recent past, since so much mortality was attributable to infectious disease over which medical practitioners had little control (LiviBacci, 1990). Widespread, significant variations in life expectancy at birth by social class status began to appear in the European record by the late eighteenth century, mainly in large urban settings (Bardet, 1983; Blum, Houdaille, & Lamouche, 1990; Perrenoud, 1979).


#### Selective Neglect vs Mortal Neglect
Mortal Neglect (S-H 1992)  
Selective: S-H 1987, and probably by others earlier? ...

Scheper-Hughes coins the term "mortal neglect" in her 1992 book, for a "pattern I first (and rather unfortunately) labeled "ethnoeugenic selective neglect" (Scheper-Hughes 1984 :540). Today I simply call it "mortal neglect. " 

Scheper-Hughes (1992)^[^[Nancy Scheper-Hughes, *Death Without Weeping: The Violence of Everyday Life in Brazil*, Berkeley and Los Angeles, Univ of California Press, 1992.] p. 343:

    Later, I learned that the high expectancy of death and the ability to face death with stoicism and equanimity produced patterns of nurturing that differentiated those infants thought of as "thrivers" and as "keepers" from those thought of as born "already wanting to die. " The survivors and keepers were nurtured, while the stigmatized or "doomed" infants were allowed to die a mfngua, "of neglect." Mothers sometimes stepped back and allowed nature to take its course. This pattern I first (and rather unfortunately) labeled "ethnoeugenic selective neglect" (Scheper-Hughes 1984 :540). Today I simply call it "mortal neglect. "

1992 p20 "Chapter 8  ...  also treats the subject of women's morality by examining close up the triage-based choices that women of the Alto must make; these choices lead to the mortal neglect of certain presumed-to-be-doomed babies."

Linger [review (1993 AmEthnologist)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/646234): 

    Alto women's "mortal neglect" of doomed infants -- a practice of "letting go"  characterized by seeming motherly indifference to the flight of the angel-babies, the anjinhos-- is a major topic of this book.

Scheper-Hughes (1987)^[Nancy Scheper-Hughes (editor), Child Survival: Anthropological Perspectives on the Treatment and Maltreatment of Children, Reidel, 1987.]
p7 Infanticide, incest, selective neglect have once again come into the public arena of anthropological discourse (Hausfater and Hrdy 1984; Korbin, ed. 1981; McKee 1984; Rohner 1975). 
p14

     In much of the contemporary world today the traditional practice of direct infanticide is proscribed by law, by religious authority, or both. The same end-point is reached, albeit more gradually, in the semi-covert practice of selective or "benign" neglect (Scrimshaw 1978; Cassidy 1980). A withdrawal of care and attention is generally sufficient to kill an infant or young child in poorer and tropical areas of the world, where many natural threats to child survival abound and where a constant parental vigilance is necessary to keep infants and toddlers alive. Marvin Harris (1977: 5) refers to selective neglect as passive infanticide. 

Sidenote -- Scheper-Hughes (1987) tends toward the view that infant mortality was class-based, which is about opposite to Lynch's view.    

    childhood mortality had a clear social class reference which allowed it to remain masked for many generations" ... offers a different view:  In short, the social construction of child survival as a medical problem about which something can and should be done is fairly recent.4 In many pockets of the western world up through the mid- to late-19th century childhood mortality tended to be viewed as an unfortunate but altogether predictable natural occurrence, and a 15% to 20% morality rate during the first year of life was not regarded as intolerable or unacceptable. For one thing, childhood mortality had a clear social class reference which allowed it to remain masked for many generations. The pernicious living and working conditions of the urban proletariat during the first half of the 19th century corresponded to the lack of social and medical concern for the mortality of working-class and underclass children. As Foucault writes, "It was of little importance whether these people lived or died, since their reproduction was [thought of] as something that took care of itself in any case" (1978: 126). 
She also (p 11) suggests "In rural Ireland up through the 19th century, deformed, sickly, or wasted infants were sometimes killed in the open fireplace or left exposed as "fairy children" (see Scheper-Hughes 1982: 143)."    
And p14 

    In much of the contemporary world today the traditional practice of direct infanticide is proscribed by law, by religious authority, or both. The same end-point is reached, albeit more gradually, in the semi-covert practice of selective or "benign" neglect (Scrimshaw 1978; Cassidy 1980). A withdrawal of care and attention is generally sufficient to kill an infant or young child in poorer and tropical areas of the world, where many natural threats to child survival abound and where a constant parental vigilance is necessary to keep infants and toddlers alive. Marvin Harris (1977: 5) refers to selective neglect as passive infanticide. In keeping with this view I would classify as "infanticide-tolerant" those segments of contemporary societies in North India (Miller, this volume), Mexico (Mull and Mull, this volume), and Northeast Brazil (Scheper-Hughes, this volume) in which the gradual wasting away and death of certain infants is not identified as a social problem, nor are aggressive (or public) efforts made to rescue the vulnerable children or to chastise their parents. It is important to note that passive infanticide is difficult to recognize and identify, since it rarely exists apart from other, more "natural" threats to the child's survival (infectious disease, poor sanitation, inadequate diet, etc.). In addition, passive infanticide and selective or benign neglect involve neither direct violence nor hostility toward the child. Rather, parental expressions of pity for the inadequate or supernumerary infant often predominate. Parental implication in the death of their infants involves, in this case, acts of omission, rather than acts of commission, such as failing to note or respond to signs of malnutrition, dehydration and other serious threats to survivability. Deaths from selective neglect are gradual and always compounded with other exogenous causes.

    Loss of the labor of females after marriage has been suggested as a contributing factor to "selective neglect" of female offspring, female infanticide, and a resulting imbalance in the sex ratio in some patrilineal, virilocal societies with dense populations (Scrimshaw 1978, Wyon and Gordon 1971, Miller 1981)

    Some of the strongest evidence comes from societies that greatly  favor children of one sex over the other.26 In such societies, differential  care leading to differential male-female mortality rates is not uncommon.  India provides an example of unexpectedly high female infant mortality  rates. One of the first studies to point out this differential infant mortality  in India was the Khanna study, which found that boys receive more food  and medical care than girls27 and that in the first five years of life the  female death rate was 74 per thousand per year while the male death rate  was 50.28 Finis Welch reports a similar finding in Bangladesh, where a  girl is more likely to survive in a family with more boys than girls.9

    highland Ecuador  ...  While people in the village would not  discuss this openly, several in-depth anthropological studies in the same  region indicated that female neglect or even infanticide occurred occasionally and that it was considered very important that the first child be male  ...  Differential male and female infant mortality in effect permits sex  selection: children of the desired sex may receive more attention, food,  and other resources that improve their chances for survival.31 The factor  of sex selection through differential care, no matter how unconscious,  offers the chance to influence the sex composition of the couple's living  children as no other currently practical method can.

#### Missing Boys?
Jim: goofball article that largely misses the point that bad material conditions of life generate a low sex-ratio! It uses SR4 -- too much noise? We'd say look for difference of SRs?  **Table 5** uses black SR1 for SBR (data lacking) -- but key is they show the Blacks' sex ratios in 1980/84 (1980 census, presumably)
rising with age -- SR1 99.4 SR04 101.0 for 1980  and SR1 98.7  SR04 101.4 for 1985/90 (either the 1985 census, or 1991).   
Francisco J. Marco-Gracia and Johan Fourie, Nov 2019 [Missing boys: Explaining South Africa’s unbalanced sex ratio, 1894-2011](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francisco_Marco-Gracia/publication/337657133_Missing_boys_Explaining_South_Africa's_unbalanced_sex_ratio_1894-2011/links/5de3a7f892851c8364583870/Missing-boys-Explaining-South-Africas-unbalanced-sex-ratio-1894-2011.pdf)
p1     When the first articles on African sex ratios were published, the (p2) Statistical Offices found very low sex ratios for the under-five populations in various countries around the continent, ... 
    They expected to find that sex ratios under five years were over 100 (more boys than girls) ... We are not the first to document this. In the Preliminary Report of the 1963 Census of Northern Rhodesia (Northern Rhodesia Government 1964: 5-6), one observer wrote: 

    In most populations more males are born than females but as male mortality is higher than female mortality there are normally more females than males in all age groups except at very young age where an excess of males can reasonably be expected. This has been true of most Western nations but it has yet to be confirmed for underdeveloped African conditions. [. . . ] It is interesting, however, to find that this peculiarity was observed in the 1962 Census of Africans in Southern Rhodesia, the 1960 Census of Tanganyika and in a recent sample survey of Swaziland. It is evident that unless there is an inherent bias in reporting sex and ages which is peculiar to Africa that accepted beliefs about the sex ratio at birth and differential mortality must be revised.
This suggests that census authorities, at least as far back as the mid-twentieth century, were aware of the missing boys of Africa. These census takers were not wrong in their initial estimations. In contrast to the rest of the world, we show, sub-Saharan countries during the twentieth century had a very low sex ratio of the under-five population, and these values are not explained by different sex ratios at birth or erroneous data.    ...  We analyse whether these extremely low values, lower than those of preindustrial and nineteenth-century Europe ... (p3) can be explained exclusively by the boysígreater likelihood of dying or if there could be other complementary factors. Our initial hypothesis is that there existed gender preferences associated with social traditions and customs that conditioned family behaviour. The existence of a preference for girls in traditional African societies, we argue, had implications for social systems (such as the prevalence of the brideprice) and for the greater number of girls than boys in the censuses.
    (p3) In this paper we argue that the important role played by women in African societies was largely responsible for the demographic pattern of gender discrimination. This research therefore provides a novel explanation for the unbalanced sex ratios based on gender preferences. Our Öndings help us not only to identify the possible causes of the anomalously low African sex ratio but also to explain several demographic and social trends in South Africaís black population today.
    THEY use UNDER-5 sex ratio -- Lesotho 1946 96.2 1966 98.1  THEY mention Garenne 2004, 2002 for Bantu low SR from Bantu genetics      p4 Our study was based on the South African censuses of 1911, 1921, 1936, 1946, 1951, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1991, 2001 and 2011. We selected these ones because of their variety of information (all of them include the black population)  ... p6  black sex ratios, which remain below 100 for almost the whole period, dropping to figures close to 90 in the Örst decades of the twentieth century.
     The biological explanation for these low sex ratios is that boys are weaker than girls during the Örst years of life (Vaupel et al. 1979; Wisser and Vaupel 2014). However, the South African sex ratios are extremely low, even in comparison with pre-industrial and nineteenth-century Europe (Mitchell 2013; Beltr·n Tapia and G·llego-MartÌnez 2017)
     In our sample of black South Africans, the low sex ratios remain almost constant from one to four years. This would suggest that no e§orts were made to reverse the e§ects of the boysíexcess mortality in the Örst months of life, which would provide further supporting evidence for our hypothesis that there was a cultural preference for girls   OUCH -- Table 5 actually displaysshows the Blacks' sex ratios in 1980/84 (1980 census, presumably)

Note from [Plowden's Report on the census of India ... 1881](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/012155211)  (1883 p. 53)

     In the Registrar General's Report of births, deaths, and marriages, in 1880, for England, the male births are given as 103.6 to 100 births of girls, and the following remarks are made:—  "There are two curious facts relating to this proportion of male and female birth, neither of which has as yet received certain explanation. The first is, that the proportion of boys to girls is smaller in England and Wales than in any other European country; and the second, that the proportion has been gradually but steadily diminishing for many years past. Comparing England and Wales with other countries, we have the following figures, which give the average number of male births to 100 female births for the 10 years 1870—79, or for those years out of the 10 for which the necessary statistics are forthcoming:—  "As regards the other point, the following figures show the gradual diminution in England and Wales of male as compared with female births:

From 1881 census (Plowden p. 54)   
    the actual disproportion between the sexes, though it might exist to some extent, and to what extent it was impossible then to say, was not anything like so great as had hitherto been portrayed by the census statistics.
 ... the nearer we approach to accuracy in the Census of a general population, the more clearly does the fact appear that there is nothing peculiar in this country in the proportion of the sexes; that if there are from 104 to 106 females to every hundred males in Europe, this proportion also obtains in India, that is in all parts of the country where female infanticide is unknown. The truth is that the great bulk of enumerators have been singularly obtuse in comprehending the fact that the counting of females was a matter of any importance in census work. To understand how this is, we must take into account **the low estimation in which females are held in this country,** and also the reticence of the people on all matters connected with their female relatives. In the registration of births and deaths the same error obtains. **The birth or death of a female child is considered such an insignificant matter,** especially among the lower classes of the population, that a great number escape registration in certain districts; and, from the causes adverted, to the numbering of the female population in 1871 was undoubtedly erroneous in so far that many were omitted in the Census schedules. But in districts where the Census work was well done it will be found that the female population is invariably in excess of the male; in fact, the general accuracy of the results of any district may be judged of by the way in which the proportions of the sexes have been recorded."

These observational studies lead to inconsistent findings regarding whether poor maternal nutritional conditions reduce the proportion of male births among human. One possible explanation for the inconsistent results is omitted variable bias.     ....     
p2888 That the abrupt decline in the proportion of male births first occurred to those who were conceived more than half a year after the famine began suggests that the earlier studies based on the Dutch Hunger Winter and Leningrad Siege failed to recover consistent evidence regarding the relationship between maternal famine exposure and offspring sex ratio at birth because the duration of the famines was insufficient.


[Sawyer (2012 PLoS Medicine)](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001287) Looks at changes in relative M/F infant and child mortality, seeing whether developing nations follow rich nations path of a gentle rise in relative male 1q0 and 4q1  Notes India, China for excess female mortality.  Cites Waldron to back up nice summary statement of infant-female survival advantage:    

      Equity in survival between females and males does not imply equal mortality rates (that is, male-to-female ratios equal to 100). Under circumstances where boys and girls have the same access to resources such as food and medical care, boys have higher mortality rates than girls during childhood, and the examined ratios would overall be expected to be greater than 100.
And she continues, explaining the bio advantage.^[Newborn girls have a biological advantage in survival over newborn boys, with lesser vulnerability to perinatal conditions (including birth trauma, intrauterine hypoxia and birth asphyxia, prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal tetanus), congenital anomalies, and such infectious diseases as intestinal infections and lower respiratory infections [4]. However, beyond early infancy, girls do not enjoy the same advantage in relation to certain infectious diseases, which are the primary causes of death in later infancy and early childhood in settings where overall mortality is high [5],[6]. Thus, the sex ratio of child mortality (that is, mortality at ages 1–4 y) is generally lower than the sex ratio of infant mortality (Figure 1).]   And has useful statement re: missing women^[Earlier studies have found numerous countries in many regions of the world, particularly southern Asia, eastern Asia, and northern Africa/western Asia, where mortality at ages 1–4 y was higher for girls than for boys [1],[10],[11]. India and China in particular have a long-documented history of female disadvantage in mortality that is covered in an extensive literature [12]–[25].]

    Our analysis of 15 developed countries shows that, as infant mortality declined over two centuries, the excess male mortality increased from 10% in 1751 to >30% by approximately 1970. Remarkably, since 1970, the male disadvantage in most countries fell back to lower levels. The worsening male disadvantage from 1751 until 1970 may be due to differential changes in cause-specific infant mortality by sex.

MIXED FINDINGS FOR OUR VIEW (some are nonsupportive, not falsifying -- they get a reduced SBR via high-carbo low-sat-fat diet)
 In particular, a diet high in saturated fats but low in carbohydrate leads to the birth of significantly more male than female offspring in mature laboratory mice, whereas when calories are supplied mainly in the form of carbohydrate rather than fat, daughters predominate. As the diets fed to the mice in these experiments were nutritionally complete and because litter sizes did not differ between treatments, dietary inadequacy seems not to be the cause for sex-ratio distortion.      
     Large ruminants
The prediction that females in better body condition would produce more male than female progeny has been observed in red deer [14, 22, 23], roe deer [24], mature ewes [25], reindeer [26], Barbary sheep [27], domestic pigs [28], and a number of other species, although there are exceptions [13, 29]. Dairy cows, but not heifers, on a high plane of nutrition give birth to proportionately more bull than female calves than cows on a poorer diet [30]. Repeat breeder cows, i.e., ones that have problems becoming pregnant by artificial insemination, also tend to produce more males [31]. The data on roe deer [24] were obtained with farmed animals on a diet controlled for low- and high-energy intake by varying the oil content. In that study, 75% of the calves born to the high-energy does were male, while the low-energy group produced only 46% males. Most other studies have been performed on wild populations, which are less well-controlled.

Jongbloet attacks -- This runs parallel with optimization of the ovulatory and conception pattern, as argued extensively elsewhere (Jongbloet, 2004a,b), e.g. in ameliorating socio-economic conditions, during prime reproductive age and prime ovulatory seasons, optimal restoration of the post-partum ovulatory pattern, etc. In contrast, male-biased conceptuses occur in the less optimal conditions, while SSR reduction occurs only in extremely unfavourable conditions, and only then as a consequence of inappropriate implantation and perishing male-biased pathological fetuses    ....

1994 Klasen (1994 World Dev)  Strong statement of SBR rising with income/SES and implicitly, with economic development.    
Klasen (1994) gives us 1980 Matzdorff 1971 Teitelbaum & Mantel; and via Google, Winston 1931 AmJSoc: p12 "prenatal mortality is heavier for the male"  pp20-21 "The sex-ratio of man at  (21) birth is a resultant of the sex-ratio at conception, such sex-ratio constantly being reduced by a prenatal mortality which bears more heavily upon the male than upon the female fetus. This mortality is importantly affected by social factors which operate indirectly through affecting the mother’s ability to provide the necessary optimum conditions for survival.    
Klasen also useful for West Life Table understates male IMR disadvantage   p1064 "Coale’s “West” Table assume that the survival disadvantage of boys is comparatively modest.”10 (n10: at LE=40 West Table male "the absolute disadvantage in the male probability to die in infancy is 29.7/1000. In the Model Life Tables “East” used below the disadvantage is much larger, namely 36.5/1000.)  But, once again, this assumption is likely to be a peculiarity of the countries that make up the “West” Tables and could be a result of preferential treatment for male infants rather than the “natural” state of affairs. The higher fragaility of male infants is likely to lead to a particularly large biological disadvantage in a high mortality environment so that in those populations the sex ratio of mortality in infancy should be higher (Waldron 1983, 1985, 1987)." Waldron sex-differences in mortality. Probably Waldron 1993 for Euro men higher mortality via drink/drive/violence     
Klasen 1994 Emphasis on SBR increase with SES. "The biomedical literature suggests that the reduction in stillbirths and late fetal mortality alone could account for these increases." For a discussion, see McKeown and Lowe (1951) and Klasen (1994b).   ...  See Teitelbaum and Mantel (1971) and Matzdorff (1980)

After considering excess female mortality in ages 1-9, Klasen (p1064) says    
      
      A second and much larger question relates to the size of the male-female mortality differential in infancy. There is little doubt that in infancy boys have a clear survival disadvantage vis-d-vis girls (Preston, 1976; Lancaster, 1990; Waldron, 1987).

ABSTRACT However, stratification of a sample  by socioeconomic indicators shows that white infant male and female  postneonatal mortality rates converge as the mothers' or parents'  education rises and as the mothers age.
p285 ...  Present findings can be seen as congruent with a theory of sex-biased parental investment.
p286  ... boys fare relatively best among the most advantaged families. Where girls have a mortality advantage in general, as in the United States, improved survival for boys means that the disparity between the sexes virtually disappears when the top echelon of society is reached ...
p288  A plausible challenge to the sociobiological interpretation of the present findings is that the convergence of infant boys' and girls' mortality in the high social status sector occurs because of the female physiological advantage and because child rearing at this pinnacle is so good. That is, the marginal gains still possible for girls are nearly zero, whereas boys, who are more vulnerable (Abramowicz and Barnett 1970; Khoury et al.  1985; Naeye et al. 1971; Yip et al. 1985; McMillen 1979), can still derive  significant incremental benefit from the best care

Among the  23 values of sex ratios at birth  below 104,  15 pertain  to populations with more than  one-third  of  the total  classified  as negro,  black  or African,  and colored or mixed. In  the light  of  other  historical evidence on the sex ratio at birth  among the  negroid  populations,  one is  led to conclude  that  there  operates, among the negroid  populations,  some genetic  or ra-cial factor  making for a slightly lower sexratio  at  birth  than  among  the non-negroid  populations.

He pointed out that there was no apparent upward trend in the sex ratio over the past 100 years in Britain, despite sharp improvements in socioeconomic conditions over that period.  <br>
Bernstein (1948, 1954) higher SRB in upper social strata, and for males in masculine occupations. <br> 
But studies fail to control for birth order or race.  <br>
p68 children born to families in the lowest Socio-economic Index category [Duncan 1961] had approx 8-9% lower odds of being a male than those born to families in the moderate and higher Soc-ec Index categories. [eg 98 vs 106]   ... <br>
If, for example, the mechanism by which socio-economic status affects sex ratio is that of differing standards of nutrition, general health and pre-natal care, we might expect a 'diminishing returns' phenomenon—a limit beyond which 'improvements' in these factors would not be biologically meaningful. A lower-middle-class woman with normal standards of nutrition, health and medical care may be, biologically speaking, no worse off than a wealthy woman attended by the most expensive private specialists. A poor woman would certainly be worse off than both in the United States, where medical care is generally arranged on a private financial basis.
p69 To summarize the findings presented here, only three of the five factors studied appear to be independently related to the sex ratio at birth. The significant negative birth-order effect, which in the first analysis accounted for a 2-6% shift in the relative odds of male birth, remained significant when adjustment for the race effect was provided in the second analysis. The magnitude of the effect was diminished by this adjustment, however, indicating that analysis for birth-order effects in the absence of adjustment for the race factor may lead to over-estimates of the importance of the birth-order factor.

Answers yes. Useful for Savorgnan (1936)who connects SBR to female health p287 As Gini and Savorgnan have pointed out, there is no evidence that a correlation exists between the quantity of nutriment and sex at birth [that in context of malnutrition of mothers claimed to raise SBR in wartime]   p288  Fifth, the most reasonable hypothesis is that of Savorgnan, who  has made the most complete study of the masculinity phenomenon.  This may be called the birth-interval hypothesis. Briefly stated,  Savorgnan maintains that masculinity in births increases in war-time on account of the greater intervals between births, which, in  turn, produces greater rest in the female reproductive system and  thereby brings about the birth of a larger number of males. ...   But how do greater intervals influence the rate of male births?  Savorgnan replies, by producing more prolonged rest and recovery  in the female reproductive organism, which, in turn, reduces the  rate of abortions and stillbirths; and since the proportion of males  in abortions and stillbirths is always higher than that of females, [p289]  the reduction of abortions and stillbirths increases the proportion of males actually born. The effect of stillbirths and abortions in  reducing the rate of male births is well-established in some coun-tries, especially in Germany and Hungary    p920 counterexamples from Egypt and India high SBR and high frequency birth  <br>

LawrencePS (1941 QRBio) p54 "Punnett (1904), who studied the sex ratio in poor and wealthy classes in London concluded that a low masculinity was associated with low social status"  p55 The bulk of the writings indicate that in a general population a high social and economic status is accompanied by a greater proportion of male births than is a low status. Also rural areas demonstrate a higher masculinity than urban districts, at least with respect to European countries. It is quite probable that part of the variation has its basis in differential rates of prenatal mortality, as has frequently been maintained. Bertillon (I875), Alberti (1934), and Taussig (1936) demonstrated that the incidence of reproductive wastage is higher for urban than for rural populations, and thus lend support to this explanation. These studies pertain to Euro data"  Ciocco differ?

This mortality is importantly affected by social factors which operate indirectly through affecting the mother’s ability to provide the necessary optimum conditions for survival.

Lenz looks at the correlation between the ratio of male to female mortality rates and "the rate of mortality on both sexes in 11 series of annual rates of mortality for different countries (in most cases the number of years included is very small, 8 or 10, in only one does it exceed 40) and he finds that in the great majority the value of r is large and negative."

p262 Of the various factors which have from time to time been brought forward to account for the determination of sex, that of nutrition appears to have found most favour. That favourable nutritive conditions tend to produce females, and unfavourable conditions males is a hypothesis which has received much support from observation and experiment on numerous forms of life 1 . In the case of the human species, however, strong evidence for or against this view is yet a desideratum. [NOTE: prevailing presumption was better nutrition would reduce the SRB! N1 is Geddes and Thomson, [*Evolution of Sex*](https://archive.org/details/evolutionsex01geddgoog/page/n5/mode/2up), pp. 41-47]<br>
p276 Summary and Conclusion <br>
If the population of London be divided into three portions exhibiting graduated poverty it is found that the proportion of MAL to FEM infants produced is lowest in the poorest portion, highest in the wealthiest portion, and intermediate in the intermediate portion. The proportion of MALs is highest of all in a number of births taken from Burkes Peerage, where the nutrition may be supposed to be of the best. From this the alternative conclusions may be drawn : that either more favourable conditions of nutrition (1) may result in a large proportion of MAL births, or (2) may have no effect on the proportion of the sexes, or (3) may even result in a relative preponderance of FEM births, but that in the last two cases the effect is masked by other factors which affect unequally the different strata of society. Such factors are shewn to exist in a differential infant mortality, a differential birth-rate, and probably also in a differential marriage-age. These factors all tend to diminish the proportion of MALs in the poorer portions of the population, and consequently render the first of the above alternative conclusions improbable. Whether the second or third of the other possible conclusions is to be accepted must remain doubtful so long as we are not in a position to estimate the quantitative effect of the factors given above. From the necessarily rough estimate which he has been able to form, the writer's opinion is that their combined effect would not be sufficiently great to mask a preponderance of FEM births due to better nutrition, and consequently he is inclined to believe that in man at any rate the determination of sex is independent of parental nutrition 1  <br>

There are two other SBR papers with Ethiopia Gibson & Mace (2003 PrRoyalSocBiol) (who happen to say "There is some evidence that male foetuses are more susceptible to exposure to toxic substances, but results on the effect of maternal nutritional condition on sex ratio are inconclusive (Lazarus 2002).)" **Is that BS?**  Hohmann & Garenne (2010 EcoHuBio c17) look at wealth, child and adult mortality in Uzbezistan and sub-Saharan Africa.

CDC Deaths 2017 Infant mortality In 2017, a total of 22,335 deaths occurred in children under age 1 year (Tables C, D, 14, and 15). This number represents 826 fewer infant deaths in 2017 than in 2016. The ratio of male to female infant mortality rates was 1.2, the same as in 2016. The infant mortality rate was 5.79 per 1,000 live births, the neonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants aged 0–27 days per 1,000 live births) was 3.84, and the postneonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants aged 28 days through 11 months per 1,000 live births) was 1.95 in 2017 (Tables C and 13; Figure 7; see Technical Notes for information on alternative data sources). Changes in the infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality rates from 2016 to 2017 were not significant.

    “addressing infant mortality as a single measure […] ? not only-disguises a fundamental fissure between neonatal and post-neonatal mortality” (Reid, 2001, 213), but also fails to take the complexity of the determinants of infant survival into account. Infant mortality is no simple matter. An infant death can be caused by a wide array of factors of very different nature. The process eventually leading to death is usually neither plain nor straightforward and is influenced by a large number of determinants that can favour its course or oppose it and even avoid its worst consequences. […] Referring to infant mortality as a whole can be necessary and even useful when we aim at providing aggregate measures, establishing comparisons or outlining trends for large populations, but we must keep in mind that it is a statistical artefact we are dealing with […]when it comes to moving from description to interpretation, a more analytical approach is required, taking into account the heterogeneity embedded in infant mortality.

The policies of environmental clean up which had so dominated late nineteenth century sanitation were giving way to different forms of intervention that focused on the behaviour of individuals, their interactions with each other and with the environment.  /    Armstrong has argued that the very subtitle of George Newman’s 1906 book was indicative of how ‘the conceptual space of infant mortality’ had shifted ‘from one traversed by sanitary axes to primarily social dimensions’ (Armstrong, 2002: 33).   p170 We focus on infant mortality in an impoverished section of north Kensington, Notting Dale, and the crèche system developed there as a philanthropic response to the social ‘problem’ of working mothers.

 279  ... The Hague evolved from a  provincial capital and quiet residential area into a  big modern city. In 1850, the city had about 72,000  inhabitants. After 1870, when prosperity increased,  the population grew steadily, reaching 206,000 at the turn of the century. More than half of this  growth was due to migration.   ... The Hague is located in an area of the Netherlands  where the highest infant mortality rates were to be  found until the 1880s. Before the onset of mortality  decline in the 1870s, infant mortality rates usually  fluctuated between 200 and 250 per thousand  births, while early-childhood mortality rates 4m1)  fluctuated between 40 and 50 per thousand person-years. Just before the decline in the first half of  the 1870s, infant and early-childhood mortality  peaked. The high infant mortality rates are thought  to have been due to the fact that much of the sur-face and ground water in the western provinces of  the Netherlands was heavily contaminated. Canals were used for the disposal of waste, while water  from the canals was used for household purposes by  the poor. A system of casks for the collection of  human excrements was established in The Hague in 1871 and a system of water pipes in 1874 (Van Son 1986 ...) . By 1910 the infant mortality rate had declined to  less than 100, while early-childhood mortality had  declined to about 10.

p9, the start of their text: 

    The basic facts about the secular decline of infant mortality in Europe have been known for nearly a century. Vital registration series are available for most European countries from the 1870s, and for virtually all of Europe from 1900. They show that the levels of infant mortality in the late nineteenth century were still extremely high and could vary quite markedly from one country to another, ranging from about 100 per 1.000 live births in Norway and Sweden to 200 or even 250 per 1.000 in countries such as Germany, Austria and Russia. At the turn of the century. however. infant mortality began to fall almost right across the continent. As the decline was steeper in the countries with higher mortality levels, a certain degree of convergence to lower levels can already be detected in the first decades of the twentieth century. By the 1950s, when national rates of infant mortality ranged between 90 and 50 per 1000, the process of convergence was nearly completed. The fall in infant mortality, which was paralleled by a simultaneous and equally pronounced decline of fertility, was responsible for raising life expectancy in many European countries by more than 10 years over a remarkably short period of time. <br><br>While the basic facts are quite clear, the reasons accounting for the decline are anything but certain. Improvements in infant and child survival have long been assumed to be broadly associated with advances in health care and rising living standards. But until fairly recently. surprisingly few attempts have been made to unravel the diverse influences of the social, economic and public health factors which have supposedly played a part in lowering infant mortality in Europe.
    
</p><p>Discussion of McKeown follows (as usual, confusing, since IMR improvements came so long after econ growth started)
</p><p>p12 
   
     It is unanimously agreed that both national and regional variations in the level of infant mortality can largely be accounted for by differences in infant feeding patterns. Indeed. if we consider the four national Cases presented in this volume, we see that breast—feeding, whose beneficial effects on infant mortality are well known n5 was widespread (though not universal) in Sweden. France and England, whereas it was only rarely practised in Austria. However, much work remains to be done in order to reach a Clear under-standing of the relationship between infant feeding and infant mortality, Social and demo-graphic historians will first have to determine the reasons why mothers in some parts of Europe undertook prolonged periods of breastfeeding while those in other regions did not. It will also be necessary to verify whether fluctuations in the levels of infant mortality correlate with changes in the duration and intensity of lactation or any other alterations in feed-ing practices. While accepting that feeding patterns strongly influenced mortality levels and that they are able to explain regional and local continuities. many scholars suspect that feeding practices are unlikely to have changed sufficiently quickly or radically to have caused the often abrupt start of the secular decline of infant mortality. In any case. feeding habits were not the only factor behind spatial variations in infant mortality.

     ... In fact, regional variations can in many cases be explained simply by the different weight of the urban component in the population, for it is well known that in historic Europe infant mortality was higher in towns and cities than in the surrounding rural areas. This was primarily due to the inferior urban public health environment and to overcrowding. which facilitated the spread of airborne and contagious diseases much more than in the sparsely populated countryside.

Interesting to speculate on: maybe rural to urban shift tends to compromise breast-feeding?

463 Norway stands out with the lowest levels throughout the period. Norwegian infant mortality was according to an estimate, close to 200 per 1,000 live births during the second part of the eighteenth century, dropping to a level of around 150 at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Towards 1850 infant mortality in Norway had dropped to a level of 100. During the second half of the eighteenth century, infant mortality in Sweden and in Finland was slightly higher than in Norway. Whereas levels of infant mortality remained at the high level of around 200 in <464> Finland until 1870, Sweden in line with Norway experienced a drop in mortality at the beginning of the nineteenth century.11 Towards the midnineteenth century, infant mortality in Sweden was around 150, a level close to Denmark’s.   ... Iceland presents more extreme levels of infant mortality, only infrequently dropping below 250 during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, levels mainly explained by the prevailing tradition of feeding the newborn artificially ....

NOTE on simulations of SR1 via SBR, IMR, and relative male/female IMR. Which are in the [WK4 spreadsheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/89gi1z7ewpyv3qh/SR1%20simulations.wk4?dl=0). Perhaps obviously, the time-pattern of infant deaths affects the SR1, as early deaths pull down the SR (because the excess male births play a smaller role in the cumulative SR1). To illustrate the magnitude of the effect: 23% IMR early-death pattern sees SR drop of 3.4 while even-death pattern has SR drop 2.4; 11% IMR early-death SR drop of 1.6 and even-death SR drop of 1.1.

2003 Sen shift in source of missing women, from mortality to selective abortion. Interesting for us is the use of SR05 as indicator of missing women. Also India division: N&W missing girls, S&E not.  

Klasen & Wink (2003 Feminist Econ) about same info as 2002? Maybe tone differs: harsher on China; more generally, notion excess fem mort stabilized at a high level
Klasen & Wink (2002 PopDevR).  As in Klasen (1994 World Dev): Coale's (1991) constant SBR overstates expected sex ratios in poor countries (and therefore understates missing women). Some improvement since 1990s. "After significant improvements in Bangladesh and Pakistan, India now has the highest share of missing females among countries for which we have reliable demographic data."  increasing use of sex-selective induced abortion

In the Model Life Tables “East” used below the disadvantage is much larger, namely 36.5/1000.)  But, once again, this assumption is likely to be a peculiarity of the countries that make up the “West” Tables and could be a result of preferential treatment for male infants rather than the “natural” state of affairs. The higher fragaility of male infants is likely to lead to a particularly large biological disadvantage in a high mortality environment so that in those populations the sex ratio of mortality in infancy should be higher (Waldron 1983, 1985, 1987)."

The paper is utter garbage. They use subsaharan Africa's relatively high death rates of women of child-bearing age to argue for missing women. And US 1900 women are dying in childbirth, creating the appearance of "missing women" there.  GARBAGE  twisting of fact that economic development has hugely reduced maternal death (and that male behavior-based deaths in rich nations is most of male deaths until old-age) ... Consider their calculation of subsaharan missing women age 20-24: their counterfactual (CF) female mortality is via the female/male rate of developed world. Devoloped has death rate (ages 20-24, throughout what follows) for males 2.94 times the female (1.1/0.4); subsahAfr male mortality is 5.7, so CF female mort is 5.7/2.94 or under 2 ... actual female mort is 9.4, so the female mortality among subsaharan women is be 9.4/(5.7/2.94) or  4.85 times actual mort.  And they use UN/WHO death rates for U1 and 1-4 to argue for missing girls in subsaharan Africa. But I bet if we looked at sex-ratios by age we would NOT see evidence of missing girls ... I bet the death rates approach and a sex-ratio approach will give opposite reulsts for subsah africa ...

ABSTR:  ... ; (2) as a proportion of the total female population, the number of missing women is largest in sub-Saharan Africa, and the absolute numbers are comparable to those for India and China; ... Finally, using historical data, we argue that a comparable proportion of women was missing at the start of the 20th century in the United States, just as they are in India, China, and sub-Saharan Africa today.   
1263  For each category—age, and later, age and disease—we posit a “reference” death rate for females, one that would be obtained if the death rate of males in that country were to be rescaled by the relative death rates for males and females (in the same category) in developed countries.6 We subtract this reference rate from the actual death rate for females, and then multiply by the population of females in that category. This is the definition of “missing women” in the category of interest   ...  In sub-Saharan Africa, the sex ratio at birth is [p1264] approximately 1.03, much lower than for developed countries as a whole (which is 1.06). There appear to be genetic differences that determine this ratio.7   n7 Indeed, the sex ratio at birth for whites in the United States is around 1.06 whereas for blacks it is 1.03. The available data for births from sub-Saharan parents in the United States suggests similar numbers as well.

Humphries (1991 Camb J Ec) explores excess mortality ages 10 through 40 in 19th C England. Sees contrast between the excess mortality in agric vs industrial counties. Agric -- deprived of food; Ind -- bad work conditions & complications from childbirth. JRI sees weak empirical work (regressions).

### Excess Female Mortality in Europe

Routine Infanticide in the West 1500–1800  G Hanlon - History Compass, 2016 - Wiley Online Library  Historians have assumed that early modern Europeans did not practice neo‐naticide similar to the great Asian civilizations, but sex‐ratio studies are only now entering the demographic literature. This article passes in review both published and unpublished research on sex


Vallin, Caselli, Surault (2006)
 excess girl-mortality via differential treatment (p. 150)^["Some studies show, for example, that within the same family, different treatment may be given to children according to their sex, especially in societies in which the preference for boys is very strong, resulting in excess mortality for girls. This has been especially demonstrated in Bangladesh (Chen et al., 1981), in Algeria (Vallin, 1979b), and in China (Calot and Caselli, 1988, 1989). This phenomenon was formerly evident in Europe (Pinnelli and Mancini, 1992, 1999; Tabutin, 1978).]

Hanawalt (1993) *Growing up in Medieval London* pp58-59 via HarrisBe (1998 in Komlos+) suggests discrim vs fem babies & kids, but not infanticide.

### Language choices (rhetoric/clarity) -- MORTAL NEGLECT & FRAIL MALE
In the context of using sex ratio differences to test for sex discrimination, we use the phrase **mortal neglect** to refer to deliberate and malicious? witholding or withdrawal of the minimal care and attention required to keep an infant or child alive (or prevent them from dying?). This is about the usage of Lynch (), and is quite different from the meaning of the phrase as used earlier by Scheper-Jones (referring to neglect of "doomed infants" -- in which case neglect hastens an imminent death). 
In the context of identifying the biological/physiological bases for male-biased infant and child mortality, we use the phrase "frail male" to refer to the male's greater susceptibility to disease and lesser resilence to malnutrion CONGENITAL STUFF too? IS THIS? This is somewhat narrower than the usage of PSYCH-GUY (DATE) who addresses the broader range of pyshc and emotional needs of boys and men, in the context of arguing for more nuturing? Challenging current stereotypes of masculinity and binaries of gender?   
OLDER COMMENTS^[Choosing our terms: mortal neglect, selective neglect, of girls? If the former, we need to footnote and clarify that we aren't using it in the sense of Scheper-Hughes). Jim's current (200618) sense is we use the term mortal neglect, and **not** in quotation marks. Instead we define mortal neglect as a *lack* of care and attention that substantially increase probability of death (like by 10%-points or more -- issue is additive, not multiplicative). Scheper-Hughes refers to *withdrawal* of care, suggesting initial care that is rescinded).]

###  leads for jim to check


#### Cuba
Seems unlikely for us -- 1950 SR1 not low; not a miserable place ...
Look at 2000ish SR1 of Cuba relative to OECD rich and to Latin America?
Look at before and after revolution ... 
https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Interpolated/  UN World Population Prospects

2017 Gonzalez & Gilleskie, *Demography*  "Using the new methodology, the IMR of Cuba likely ranges between 9.04 and 10.11
infant deaths per 1,000 live births compared with the 5.79 reported officially."  
FRED 2004 values:  Cuba 5.8  Costa Rica 9.2 Chile 7.9    World Bank
We look at SR1 and find ... UN Data is odd, 2004 Cuba SR1 1.08? 

2012  Ward & Devereaux   1953 Cuba middle income ...

also some crappy stuff drawing on G&G's Demography, in *Health Policy and Planning* -- questioning validity of data and arguing for forced abotion Berdine, Gelso, Powell; Hirschfield; seems like politically motivated shit


#### Spain

For lit review only (Tapia & Gallego-Martinez allude to declining SR1 and worsening conditions)
Tapia & Gallego‐Martínez (2017 EEH, 2020 EHR) Use sex-ratios to look gender discrimination; uses European SR04 for comparisons 
2017 p120n22 The decline in the sex ratio during the last third of the 19th century might be related to the worsening of living conditions during the first stages of modern economic growth (Martínez-Carrión and Pérez-Castejón, 2002, 421). 

2020EHR What explains the missing girls in nineteenth-century Spain?   2020EHR repeats 2017 discussion of SR1 and SR04 and Spain's suspiciously high sex ratios. 
2017 p Therefore, instead of around 105.9, infant sex ratios in the absence of gender discrimination should have been expected to be somewhat just below parity (99.4) in mid-19th century Spain.19 
p66  Due to the female biological survival advantage in utero and during infancy, sex ratios should theoretically be lower under severe economic conditions.40 If, on the contrary, economic deprivation shows a positive relationship with the prevalence of boys, it would be evidence of potential gender discrimination, in the form of either female infanticide or the neglect of young girls, especially in terms of nutritional deprivation and susceptibility to infection. It may be the case that both effects offset each other, so the lack of a clear relationship between these variables and the sex ratio might be (cautiously) interpreted as weak evidence of gender bias <br>  n40 OUCH -- cites own EEH -- maybe earlier discussion justifies the cavalier (light) validation/evidence <br>p74 Rather than being the result of female infanticide or the mistreatment of young girls, the excess female mortality discussed here was probably due to an unequal allocation of resources within the household


2017EEH Where are the missing girls? Gender discrimination in 19th-century Spain  
5 The demographic transition in Spain did not start until the late 19th century and the early 20th century (Dopico and Reher, 1998). Anthropometric evidence confirms the deplorable living conditions existent in mid-19th-century Spain. See, for instance, Martínez-Carrión and Pérez-Castejón (2000), Martínez-Carrión (2002) or Moreno-Lázaro (2006)

### Jim's notes on Soviet/Russian Stuff ###

 ? https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/hunger

infant mortality debate -- was 1970s rise of soviet IMR a figment of improved reporting in southern republics (Muslim)? Maybe we can use behavior of SR1 (but a Kyrgistan paper argues for son-preference and selective abortion there, more recently)

Jones & Grupp p214pdf3 section title  "Soviet infant mortality in  historical perspective"   1909 IMR 297 in European Russia (note 11:(Statistical Reference Book of the USSR for 1928 (Moscow)); "infant death rates in Moscow and St. Petersb were double those of Paris and London" (n12) p215 By 1925 European RSFSR 229   1926 193  1927 217  1917 Ukraine 148 Belorussia 99      "Reported infant mortality for the USSR as a whole was 182 in 1940, up  from 174 in 1926. n19   The higher 1940 figure was probably due to better reporting  of infant deaths in the European areas and the inclusion of data from high- [p216] mortality southern tier areas that had previously been excluded "   Turkmenistan probably higher than the reported 250 in 1939 (n20)       After WWII IM declines in European areas of USSR  Leningrad  1940 196  1945 148 1950 82     p217 RSFSR rate 37 "higher than the reported rates for four of the five Muslim republics for which we have data."(p218)  " The lower reported rates in the southern tier areas were due to faulty  reporting, not better health conditions"  p227 southern tier areas  "Increasingly  complete reporting in these regions produced erratic increases in reported infant  death rates in the 1960s, followed by a dramatic upsurge in reported infant  mortality in the early 1970s."   Some small increase in IMR in Euro-Russia, p233 maybe connected to reduced stillbirths via resusitation  of asphixia victims    Velkoff & Miller largely disagree, claiming it's post neo-natal rural deaths that increase (seems like a non sequitur to me)
