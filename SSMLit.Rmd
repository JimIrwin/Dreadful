re:IMR and stillbirth definitions. In concluding his discussion of IM in his chapter "Cohort Life Tables" Vallin says (2006:127)     

      Apart from these issues linked to the definition of commonly used indicators, let us note in conclusion that the measurement of infant mortality is sometimes impeded by problems of defining life and death. Registered deaths are registered precisely by virtue of the legal definition that makes it possible to distinguish between live births and stillbirths. This definition differs from country to country. Some statistical institutes try—with varying degrees of success—to compile additional information to identify, among the stillborn, those who actually lived without being able to attain the legal status of live births: these are known as false stillbirths. Such attempts are broadly consistent with the universal definition proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO).14 To analyze infant mortality with precision, we need to investigate the definition that actually matches the statistical tables used.

in Caselli 2006 4vol -- Catherine Gourbin Ch 32  Fetal Mortality  (mostly 20th C and later)
[Fetal Morality] It acquired some importance through the concept of perinatal mortality (stillbirths plus infant deaths at 0–6 days) that Peller (1948) introduced to avoid the errors caused by unreliable data on infants’ vital status at birth.  
   Peller 1948   Peller Sigismund, 1948. Mortality, past and future. Population Studies, vol. 1(4), p. 405–456  p413  
   
           It is very difficult to ascertain the facts about stillbirths. The figures reported are the least reliable in the whole realm of vital statistics, and they also affect the re-liability of the data on deaths in the first day after birth. In one country, for religious or other reasons, many stillborn children are registered as 'died after christening', which means that they are included among deaths in the first day of life. In another country, where compulsory registration is limited to children born alive, a child who dies immediately after birth is not registered atall, just as if he were stillborn. In still other instances infants who, shortly after birth, died either from violent or natural causes, are wrongly registered as stillborn, deflating one rate and inflating the other. 4 The League of Nations tried to create a common basis for comparisons of various years and areas but failed, as no agreement was reached regarding the term 'stillbirth'.  
           As long as such a situation prevails we shall be able to eliminate gross mistakes and misconceptions only by pooling stillbirths and deaths occurring during the first week in one single group to be called perinatal deaths. Such pooling is the more justified because both sets of phenomena are under the influence of, and governed by, the same factors. 
           
   Dominique Tabutin, "Information Systems in Demography" (Ch 121 of Caselli )  pp498-99 -- inconsistencies in stillbirth definition in later 20th C europe
   
     Another problem that is crucial for comparison over time or space is the variability in the legal definitions of events, particularly regarding stillbirths and live births. In Europe alone, despite World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) recommendations and efforts at statistical homogenization in the region, registration criteria still vary considerably (Gourbin and MasuyStroobant, 1995). For example, although WHO has for a long time recommended that each birth where the child has shown any sign of life should be recorded as a live birth, in 1998, 5 out of 22 European countries still restricted the criteria by limiting the type of sign of life required or by requiring a minimum life span (Czech Republic). This has resulted in five different definitions. In the same year, only four countries followed WHO’s 1975 recommendations on stillbirths14 and, in {p499} 2003, there were still seven different definitions of stillbirth in Europe. This results in problems and requires the greatest prudence in international comparisons, notably when relating to rare phenomena that are sensitive to changes in definition, such as the rate of stillbirths, perinatal mortality, or infant mortality in developed countries.

### new stuff to review and then move (to the proper place in the page)

Tavasolli et al    
In this paper, we try to find the association between air pollution and infant mortality during late 19th century and the dawn of 20th century.     

    Like pollution, data on infant mortality and more importantly fetal death has been scarce.  ...      However, gender ratio has been shown to provide a quite robust proxy for fetal deaths. Male embryos are more susceptible to external stressors like pollution during prenatal development and more likely to suffer health problems during infancy as a respond to such stressors (Sanders and Stoecker (2011)). Therefore, during periods of large external shocks to utero, the reproductive system will be biased to produce more XX–chromosomes combination rather than XY–combination and as a consequence the probability of a live birth being girl increases. The latter probability is the dependent variable in this paper for analysis at household level while the female ratio to total number of children is the proxy used for county level regressions.   
    Using these proxies, we show that one thousandth of logarithm of employment in manufacturing is associated with 1–3% increase in the probability of a live birth being female. Wefindthat Mothers in counties with higher degrees of manufacturing industries were more likely to give birth to daughters, experience the fetal, prenatal, and infant death.
 
      Although all the coefficients are relatively small, one fact highlights their importance. A 1% increase in the probability of having more daughters than sons, or in other words, a 1% increase in the ratio of female newborns to total livebirths is a strong respond from the reproductive systems of mothers to environmental shocks. 

conjecture: Tavassolli et al do not posit our IMR SR relationship
 effects of (air) pollution on fetal and infant mortality

their abstract: This paper aims to assess the effects of industrial pollution on infant mortality between the years 1850-1940 using full count decennial censuses.  … Since male embryos are more vulnerable to external stressors like pollution during prenatal development, they will face higher likelihood of fetal death. Therefore, we proxy infant mortality with different measures of gender ratio.

Male embryos are more susceptible to external stressors like pollution during prenatal development and more likely to suffer health problems during infancy as a respond to such stressors (Sanders and Stoecker (2011)).

<S&S 2011 Our solution to these complications, using changes in the sex ratio of live births as a proxy for changes in fetal health, exploits the medical finding that male fetuses are more susceptible to death from external stresses. >

REMARK ON ITALY DATA QUALITY The estimated SRXs range from 3 through 101, with a mean of 51.9 over the period. The low and high values occur in Sweden and Italy, respectively. These two countries have data series extending prior to 1900, and also have large standard deviations. This is likely due to relatively poor data quality in the early years.


de Hansen (1979) re: SIDS and IM in 19th C ENgland
p342  McKeown stresses that throughout the century infant mortality actually increased, and did not fall until the early 20th century, well after the onset of a decline in fertility (1976: 63). In 1910 there were 105 infant deaths per 1000 live births, in 1920, 80, and in 1930, 60 per 1000 (Tilly and Scott, 1978: 102)  

Ji DISSENTS FROM deHansen's reading of McKeown, who says on p63 simply that for the 19th and early 20th C "it is necessary to combine prematurity with other diseases of infancy. It should be emphasized that deaths in this class increased in the late nineteenth century, and did not fall until after 1901. This largely explains the observation that the decline of infant mortality was delayed until after 1901.

McKeown (1967:123) draws on Beaver to argue for importance of milk quality for reducing IM  <discussed more in next chapter>

<br> p5Before considering the relative numbers of boys and girls in the Greek censuses, it is important to note that child sex ratios in the past are not comparable to contemporary ones because mortality levels during infancy and childhood have a direct influence  on sex ratios in these age groups. Due to the survival advantage of females, harsher environments are especially deleterious to boys (especially during the first years of life), thus increasing their relative mortality and resulting in lower sex ratios. Following the estimation in Beltrán Tapia (2019, pp. 5–6), Figure 2 plots the available information on infant mortality and child sex ratios (ages 0–4) in European countries between 1750 and 2001 and illustrates the negative relationship between these two variables. According to these estimates, infant mortality of slightly below 200 deaths per 1,000 live births (in line with the values reported for Greece during the second half of the nineteenth century [Valaoras 1960, p. 132]), should yield child sex ratios of around 101 boys per 100 girl

Easterlin (1999 EurRevEcHi) "How beneficent is the market? A look at the modern history of mortality"
<br>(Abstract, p257) A short answer is, not very. In contrast to economic growth, where the free market is commonly viewed as a prime mover, mortality in the last two centuries has not been greatly helped by market forces. The classic sources of market failure - information failures, externalities, public goods, principal-agent, and free rider problems - have been pervasive. Nor has economic growth itself been behind the worldwide improvement in life expectancy. In the primitive state of nineteenth century health knowledge, the immense rise in urbanisation engendered by economic growth largely vitiated any positive level-of-living effects by increasing exposure to disease. Instead, public policy initiatives, based on new knowledge of disease and new institutions, have been essential to the improvement of life expectancy, both in urban areas and nationwide.</p>
<p>p257 The concept of human development has recently emerged to rival economic development as a worldwide objective of public policy ... In assessing human welfare, advocates of this concept would, at a minimum, place indicators of social conditions, notably life expectancy and educational achievement, on an equal footing with traditional economic measures like GDP per capita and a poverty index ... political and civil liberties. In this article, I focus on only one of the proposed new measures, life expectancy at birth (referred to subsequently
simply as life expectancy).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is fair to say that, so far as life expectancy is concerned, the common reaction among many economists and economic historians is scepticism of the broader measure of human development. This is because improved life expectancy is typically viewed as a natural by-product of <p258> economic development or of the institutional conditions that foster economic development. Thus, elevating life expectancy to the status of a social goal commensurate with economic growth raises no issues that are not already being dealt with in the study of economic growth and its determinants.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is this view to which the present article is addressed. Specifically, the questions of concern here are: (1) is life expectancy largely or wholly a function of economic growth? (2) If not, are the conditions commonly taken to foster economic growth, namely, free markets, private property, and freedom of contract, also responsible for promoting the advance of life expectancy? As a basis for forming tentative answers to these questions, this article examines the nature and causes of the historical improvement in life expectancy
over the period chiefly from 1800 to 1950.
</p>
<p>p261 This Section addresses the presumption that the historical improvement in life expectancy is due to the favourable effect of economic growth on living levels.3 It first presents evidence that the long term trends in life expectancy and economic growth are not closely related, drawing on the record of six countries with relatively good data. It then considers why the relationship between the two has been quite weak in the historical past (see also Kunitz and Engerman 1992).</p> 
<p>We'll use HMD data, so don't fuss with Easterlin's timing. 
<br>
p261 “The first point of note is that life expectancy is marked by a sharp increase in the rate of improvement, starting in the late nineteenth century” ... England 1871  Sweden 1875  France 1893     [oddly, his T1 has only a 12 yr gain in e0 from 1871 to 1921 -- Mitchell shows +17yrs (and I bet ONS does too)]
<br>
p262 Note that Easterlin's choice of 1871 for "take-off" of e0 is very strange -- it relies on decadal life-table values, and has the following values for male e0 q0: <br>
1861 40.51 q0 178, 1871 39.22 q182, 1881 44.18 146, 1891 41.94 177, 1901 45.40 177, 1911 49.36 146.54, 1921 55.98 88.4; (1861 female q0 143.5 e0 43.0) 
<br> in short -- Those life tables do show 1861 & 1901 with same IMR (178,177) and 5 years different life expectancy. And the same pattern is evident in Mitchell's annual series of e0 and q0. But is there any empirical validity to the e0? Or is it just more life-table BS?
<br>
FIGURE 2 Easterlin's 1871 **"take-off"** of e0 -- I average m&f e0 in Mitchell's EHS, there  e0 is 41 1869/71 and 43 1877/79 44 1880/84  45 1886/92 in the early 1890s and 46 by 1900 ... My reading: 1850-71 40-41 yrs  1881-85 45 yrs  1888-1900 46 yrs  
<br>**CAUTION** Easterlin relies on Keyfitz and Flieger (1968) pp36-39 show summary stats from Life Tables. p520 the Life Tables have (male) 1861 q0 177 e0 40.5; 1871 q0 178.5 e0 39.22; 1881 q0 146.74 e0 44.185  
1861 female q0 143.5 e0 43.0 ; 1871 
</p><p>
p265 If the McKeown hypothesis is correct, then the take-off dates for life expectancy should conform closely to those for economic growth. But the two do not fit closely at all (Table 2). The contrast between Sweden and England is striking. Their take-offs in life expectancy are almost identical, but those in economic growth differ by about three-quarters of a century. 
<br>Taken as a whole, the evidence for the six countries suggests that the rapid improvement in life expectancy started later than modern economic growth, but spread more rapidly. In none of the six countries did rapid improvement in life expectancy start before the 1870s, whereas economic growth was underway in two, perhaps three, of the six countries by that time.
<br>p266 My interest here is in the factors responsible for the high rate of improvement in life expectancy post take-off, because it is this improvement that has lifted life expectancy to wholly unprecedented levels. But a brief word is needed about the mild improvement observed in all six countries before takeoff, because of the temptation to assume that this is the product of economic growth. 
<br> In all six of the countries included here^[England, Sweden, France, Japan, Brazil, India] the phase of mild improvement in life expectancy is associated with a reduction in smallpox mortality as vaccination was introduced.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, there is reason to doubt whether the acceleration in economic growth that started in western Europe after 1800 was having any sizeable positive effect on life expectancy. SSome analysts have pointed out that in the middle of the nineteenth century there is a flattening of the trend in life expectancy both in England and France, despite rising income levels (cf. Figures 2 and 4, and Fogel 1994; Schofield, et al ., 1991, ch. i; Szreter 1988, 1997; Vallin 1991). They suggest that the positive effect of economic growth on life expectancy due to better living conditions was countered by another effect of economic growth - the redistribution of population to high-mortality urban centres.4 4 Before its take-off, life expectancy in urban areas was about ten years less than in rural, reflecting the more rapid spread of disease where population density is high and also under the crowded conditions of factory production as modern economic growth took hold ... As the population became more concentrated in low-life-expectancy urban areas, there was a negative effect of economic growth on life expectancy.
<br>Indeed, some scholars argue that the slope of the relationship [e0 & pcInc] in a pre-modern mortality regime may have been negative (Mosk and Johansson 1986). 
<br>270 The major breakthroughs of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that were eventually to bring fatal infectious diseases generally under control can be briefly outlined. They fall under three principal headings:
<br>(1) New methods of preventing the transmission of disease, including education of the public, starting in the mid-nineteenth century, <br>(2) New vaccines to prevent certain diseases, starting in the 1890s, and <br>(3) New drugs to cure infectious disease (antimicrobials), starting in the late 1930s.
<br>p274 The point was previously made that under the mortality regime prevailing in the first half of the nineteenth century - before the onset of sustained advance in the knowledge and technology of disease control - the positive relation between life expectancy and per capita income that would be expected on the basis of improved living levels was undercut by the positive association between urbanisation and per capita income. The differential trend between rural and urban mortality brought about by the new technology of disease control significantly altered this relationship. As unfavourable urban health conditions were gradually removed by the new techniques, and excess urban mortality eliminated, the adverse effect of urbanisation on life expectancy evaporated, leaving only the positive effect of per capita income via higher living levels. Thus the new technology of disease control had the effect of increasing the slope of Preston's functional relationship between life expectancy and per capita income, as well as shifting that relationship upward (cf. Mosk and Johansson 1986, p. 420). 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Associated with the epidemiological transition there was also a take-off in stature much like that in life expectancy ... 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p275  To recapitulate the argument to this point, in the state of knowledge regarding health and mortality prevailing in the early nineteenth century, economic growth had at best only a small positive effect on life expectancy. This is because the positive effect of economic growth via improved living levels was substantially offset by a growing exposure to disease as the population became more urbanised. Only as advances in knowledge led to the development and use of new methods of controlling infectious disease both in urban areas and nationwide did rapid improvement in life expectancy occur.
<br>It is this question - the role of the market in the great improvement of life expectancy - to which this Section is addressed. By the 'market' I mean supply and demand conditions operating within the institutions of private property and free contract to allocate resources via the incentive of private profit to the satisfaction of human wants - in this case wants with regard to the elimination of disease and reduction of mortality.
<br>[lengthy coverage of knowledge and policies for public health]
<br>p287 The control of infectious disease involves serious issues of market failure - information failures, externalities, public goods, principal-agent problems, and so forth. The market cannot be counted on for such things as the provision of pure water and milk, the proper disposal of sewage, control of pests such as mosquitos and rats, the supply of uncontaminated food and other manufactured products, immunisation of children and adults against major infectious diseases, and the dissemination of new knowledge regarding personal hygiene, infant and child care, food handling and preparation, care of the sick, and the like. There is also a serious market failure problem with regard to the distribution of antimicrobials because of externalities associated with the development of disease-resistant bacteria. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  p287  The title of this article posed the question, how beneficent is the market? The ubiquity of market failure in the control of major infectious disease supplies the answer: if improvement of life expectancy is one's concern, the market cannot do the job. Implementation of the new techniques of disease control has required the development of new institutions, centering on the public health system
<br>p288 Rather than a story of the success of free market institutions, the history of mortality is testimony to the critical need for collective action.

VALLIN 1991 Mortality in Europe from 1720 to 1914: long-term trends and changes in patterns by age and sex, in [Schofield et al.](https://archive.org/details/declineofmortali0000unse) (at Internet Archive). pp38-   INTERESTING REMARK about when/why data becomes available
<br>p38. On the eve of the First W W the demographic transtion in Europe was far from complete and, in particular, the decline in mortality had a long way to go: indeed it had hardly begun.  ... we are well aware of what has happened since that time, our knowledge of earlier developments is often vague, sometimes confused, and always incomplete. pp40-41 crude death rate graphs [I'll skip, and focus on HMD instead]  p42 1.1 The Reduction of Variability [of CDR]. 
<br>p43 In France, there is evidence of a clear decline in the cdr between 1750 and 1845 (we have no data for earlier <p44> years), but during the following 40 years the death rate did not change appreciably and only resumed its decline toward the end of the 1880s. In England  ... 'normal' mortality appears to have been constnat throughout the 18th C until the 1820s ... brief period of decline which lasted for about ten years ... succeeded by a renewed period of near-constancy ... until the 1870s. After that date, however, decline became rapid and continuous."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most surprising ... is the lower mortality which England seems to have enjoyed, when compared with France, at the beginning of the period. 
<br>1720-49 French CDR 32-35 /k    peak 49 in 1747.  England 1720-49 25-28 /k peak 37 in 1742.
<br>During the following 1/2 C, health standards improved in Fr but not in Eng,  [by 1820] mortality levels in the two countries were similar. Thereafter ... curves similar ... until about 1875, when mortality in Eng fell both earlier and more rapidly than in France ...
<br>p45 It is, however, clear that throughout the 19th c the fall in mortality in both Norway and Sweden was more regular than in either England or France, where there was a period of stagnation. This period of stagnation which occurred later in France than in England (1845-90 compared with 1830-75) seems to have coincided with the years of greatest social hardship caused by industrialization under a capitalist system.

<br> the course of infant mortality in different Euro countries between 1720 and 1920. Swed, Eng, Fr
<br> Changes are similar to those that we have traced in crude death rates, though there are some slight differences. underestimation of infant mortality in England (and possibly also in Sweden) at the beginnninng of the 18th C. It is more interesting that between 1845 and 1890 when the crude death <p50 figure; p51> in France remained stationary,  [IMR] curve / was dome-shaped. Infant mortality increased considerably between 1850 and 1870 and did not resume its decline until 1895.  ... most severe period of inzn in France ... deterioration in the health of an increasing proportion of young children ... industrial working class.  young mothers ... work outside their homes ... give out their children to be nursed, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England, the movement of IM until 1875 was almost exactly the same as that of the c d r, which had remained on a plateau since 1830. ... (gains 1875-1885 cancelled by) increase between 1885 and 1900, and it was only after that date (five years later than in France) that a real new decline occurred. More clearly than the crude death rate, the course of IM suggests that the first stage of public-health transition was limited to the end of the e18th and the beginnings of the n19th centuries. From then, we would have to wait until the end of the n19th cent to discern the great wave of mortality decline which was to continue throughout the t20th. The FWWar did not mark the limit of a period of transition, and the cut-off points that have been chosen are, to some extent, arbitrary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... division of the transition into two distinct phases, which was typical of England and France [possibly Norway but data lack] ... did not apply to Sweden. ... IM fell continuously, except for year-to-year fluctuations, from the moddle of the e18th C onwards,
<br>p52 Italy IM "rate declined continuously and rapidly from 1863 onwards and reached the same level as in Eng and Fr by about 1900.
<br>Differences between infant mortality rate in different Euro countries were probably largest around 1850. By that time important progress had already been achieved in some countries (Norw, Swed, Eng, Fr) [Norway ~100; others ~150-160 -- via Mitchell IHSEur and Vallin's figure 3.4]
<br>p66 Hoever, even the limited amount of data at our disposal makes it possible to reach some conclusions about the characteristics of mortality during the two centuries [1720-1920]. Even though the health transition has resulted in a reduction, and later in an elimination, of years of 'crisis' mortality, and the beginning of a reduction in 'normal' mortality everywhere, the overall impression is, none the less, one of extreme diversity. This applies both to the dates when the transition began (the mid-e18th c in France, the end of the n19th c in Germany and Russia) and to the trend of decline (regular and continuous in Sweden for three centuries, a long period of stagnation during the middle of the 19th c in France and England).

### Germany ###

<p>
Gallardo-Albarrán (2020 EHR)^[Sanitary infrastructures and the decline of mortality in Germany, 1877–1913]  Seems similar to Alsan & Goldin, not looking at overll IMR, but at the urban component (so issue of shift from rural to urban not covered).
<p>Figure 1 presents Prussia IMR 1877-1913. Urban IMR volatile, but seems to start to decline from mid1880s (230-250) to late 1890s (200-220), then steeper decline 1900-1913 (ends at about 150 in 1913). With elimination of urban penalty circa 1901-1906. Rural IMR hovers in the 180-200 range, by my eyeball. p739 Table 1 reports mean IMR 213
<br> As noted, G-A reports that infant mortality in German cities "declined by almost half" from the 1870s to WW1 (p731). Mitchell's IHS says Germany IMR 1860s 300ish falling to 1880s 230ish  1900 205ish (p121,123).
<br>p745 reports the logCDR in sample fell 0.54 (so level fell to 58%), with .109 of that from water & sewage. p746 reports logIMR fell 0.439 (to 64.5%), and attributes 0.108 of that to water & sewage.
<br>In conclusion, they write, "This article has studied the causes of the first sustained decline in mortality in Germany by looking at the role of public health infrastructures." Interesting to note the German U5 is 100.5 in 1871, 1880; 100.7 in 1890, 1900; then 101.4 in 1910; big rise comes by 1925 with 103.4.

The creation of the German Empire after the Franco-Prussian War also coincides with the sustained mortality decline and with improved statistical coverage. The crude death rate declined from 28.9 per 1000 in 1871 to 16.7 in 1910, while the expectation of life at birth (for both sexes combined) rose from 37.0 in 1875 to 48.8 years by 1910. The infant mortality rate fell from 246 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 1869/73 to 170 in 1908/12 (Haines and Kintner, 2000, Table 3 & Table 4). Despite its rapid economic development prior to World War I, Germany was still, however, one of the nations with high mortality and especially high infant mortality. Compare, for example, the infant mortality rates for some other nations for the period 1908/12: Sweden, 75; Norway, 70; England and Wales, 112; the Netherlands, 112; Switzerland, 109; France, 123 (Mitchell, 1998, Table A7).

Vögele has Hamburg IMR 1870s 220ish (204-239), 1880-87 200-300, 1906-13 115to165
<p>Vögele (2000 Health & Place, 41-55)
<br>p41  From a historical perspective the towns in Europe were perceived as extremely unhealthy places with extremely high mortality rates. These conditions have been investigated very intensively for England and Wales. During the nineteenth century, the mortality rates in the rapidly growing English industrial towns and centres of commerce were high and surmounted the average mortality of rural areas and the state by far. To focus on this fact the terms 'Urban Penalty' or 'Le Handicap Urbain' were coined (Kearns, 1988, 1993). Especially, tuberculosis has been considered the archetypal disease of the industrialization process.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A further characteristic of the secular mortality development, however, is the substantial improvement of the mortality rates in various towns in Europe and North-America towards the end of the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth century. The differences between the mortality rates in towns and those in rural areas diminished and the excessive urban mortality rates decreased or even disappeared completely (VoÈgele,1996 [Where he cites Condran & Cheney 1982 Denog ]).

    p45 Some biological studies emphasised a decrease in male-female height  differences under conditions of nutritional stress (Wolanski and Kasprzak 1976; Gray and Wolfe 1980; Brauer 1982; Lieberman 1982; Stini 1985). According to these studies, dimorphism increases with improvement in nutritional status. Based on these findings and their biological theorising, they hypothesised that women are more ‘resilient’ during crisis periods.fferences under conditions of nutritional stress (Wolanski and Kasprzak 1976; Gray and Wolfe 1980; Brauer 1982; Lieberman 1982; Stini 1985). 
p46  Though Tanner argues for the existence of female robustness in the situations of radiation and undernutrition, there is a dearth of information about sample size and physiological mechanisms.

p51  Johnson and Nicholas (1995) argued that both males and females born between the early 1820s and the mid-1850s in the UK suffered from nutritional stress. 

p53 Also, heights in Kazakhstan – one of the former Soviet republics in Central Asia – have been stagnating or declining, with the height of girls developing even worse than boys’ height due to religiously induced discrimination in the labour market (Dangour et al. 2003).

Harris (2009 Ch 4 of *Gender and Well-being in Europe*)
   According to James Tanner (1962: 127), ‘girls … are less easily thrown off their growth curves … than boys’ and McCance argued that ‘males are more vulnerable [to undernutrition] … and rehabilitate less completely’ (see Thomson et al. 1967).  British Journal of Preventive & Social Medicine

   p65 These findings appeared to reinforce Tanner’s view that girls were more resistant to adverse conditions and that there was more scope for the heights of boys to increase as conditions improved (Harris 1998: 425–8)


ThomsonA et al 1967  

     p139 It is generally agreed that adult stature responds less dramatically to environmental improvement than does the stature of children. Most of the evidence of secular increase in adult stature has been derived from men, and there may be a sex difference.      {PARAG} McCance (1966) notes that "Males are more vulnerable [to undernutrition in early life] than females in some and possibly all species and rehabilitate less completely." Acheson and Fowler (1964) considered that "Boys are more readily influenced by environmental factors than are girls, both as to their rate of skeletal maturation and to their linear growth." Bakwin and McLaughlin (1964) found that male Harvard entrants from public schools (Americanstyle) had increased in average height, but not those from private schools; but female entrants to Wellesley showed no change in either group. It may be noted that, by contrast with these highly selected American groups, the Aberdeen mothers cannot in general be considered as having grown up in an optimum or near-optimum environment.

ABSTRACT: In the long-running debate over standards of living during the industrial revolution,pessimists have identified deteriorating health conditions in towns as undermining the positive effects of rising real incomes on the ‘biological standard of living’. This article reviews long-run historical relationships between urbanization and epidemiological trends in England, and then addresses the specific question: did mortality rise especially in rapidly growing industrial and manufacturing towns in the period c. 1830–50?  Using comparative data for British, European, and American cities and selected rural populations, this study finds good evidence for widespread increases in mortality in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. However, this phenomenon was not confined to ‘new’ or industrial towns. Instead, mortality rose in the 1830s especially among young children (aged one to four years) in a wide range of populations and environments  ...  Instead, mortality rose in the 1830s especially among young children (aged one to four years) in a wide range of populations and environments

     ... dramatic improvement in urban life expectancy after c. 1750 

p459 death rates in English cities in the mid-nineteenth century were modest by the standards of many continental European cities. This was particularly the case with respect to infant mortality, but mortality at older ages was also unexceptional. London, then the largest city in Europe, was extraordinarily salubrious compared with much smaller British and continental cities.17 However, even the unhealthiest British cities, including Liverpool, Manchester, and Glasgow, were unremarkable by continental standards.18     

p462     The deterioration in mortality after 1820 was, according to Szreter, driven in the main by a rise in mortality from ‘infectious diseases and sanitation diseases, especially at ages 3–24 months’.

p463 Here we take three new approaches to improve our understanding of urban mortality patterns in England in the first half of the nineteenth century.
       ... Taken together our findings refute the specific claims made by Szreter and Mooney, that mortality worsened particularly in fast-growing industrial and manufacturing towns and was most extreme in the decades of the 1830s and 1840s. Instead they support, and extend, Woods’s interpretation of both the trends and the causes of urban mortality patterns in this period



p467 figures -- maybe rural 120  urban therefor 180 ... 


The synchronized rise and fall of scarlet fever as a major cause of early childhood mortality between c. 1830 and c. 1870, in populations across Europe and North America, suggest very strongly that this was an autonomous biological phenomenon driven by changes in the virulence of the pathogen, albeit one that was propagated by networks of communication between international ports, and between ports and their hinterlands.


p481 the worsening of urban mortality rates in the middle decades of the nineteenth century was not confined to British industrial towns and cities. Rather it appears to have been a very widespread phenomenon that affected rural as well as urban populations.       ....     However, scarlet fever should be considered a major explanatory factor.   
Our evidence indicates that there were indeed very widespread rises especially in early childhood mortality in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, that were sustained until roughly 1870.
p482 ... (re height declines)  Our results therefore lend tentative support to arguments that childhood health and development were depressed in the mid-nineteenth century. However, it remains very unclear whether the observed hikes in childhood mortality, especially from scarlet fever, were associated with increases in chronic ill health, or represented acute events with few sequelae for survivors

    The standard of living of the working class has been a particularly contentious issue in the historiography of the industrial revolution. The classic debate centred on the first half of the nineteenth century and concerned the impact of industrialization. More recently, attention has turned to the eighteenth century: was Britain a high wage economy in the run‐up to the industrial revolution?60  ...  King, Massie, and Colquhoun ... these social observers ... In their eyes, England was definitely a high wage economy. English workers were always very well off by international standards: The average member of a working‐class family in England always got more than three subsistence baskets each year (table 5), while many Europeans, Latin Americans, and Asians were lucky to get one.61  ...  English workers did not consume three times the oatmeal specified in the subsistence diet but instead upgraded their consumption to bacon, beer, and white bread. For this reason, English men were also taller than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.62 (cite Floud, Fogel, Harris, Hong &  Restatement,)

Experiences among this sector were also much more diverse, with a few families living on a per capita income that was on a par with the agricultural workers, a few earning four or five times as much, and the rest scattered widely between these two extremes.

p110  Rural society was largely unchanging and remarkably equal, but only because the great majority of workers had so miserably little in the first place. The incomes of industrial families were, on average, higher, but they were also much more divergent       As male incomes rose, their breadwinning became more unreliable, which created new forms of inequality within families as well as between them    
The evidence is clear: industrialization ushered in a far more complex, and unequal, society than that which it replaced. It is time to abandon the optimist/pessimist framework and to develop suitably plural, historical approaches and perspectives.  
p111  Industrialization did not just raise wages, lengthen working hours, depress heights, and so on. It wrought fundamental changes in patterns of family life, human existence, and social relations. So long as male wages had provided for no more than the meanest subsistence, all members of the family were tightly bound in a nexus of needs and responsibilities; but when men were able to earn something better than a subsistence wage they — and they alone — were freed from that nexus.    changes within the family dynamic   significant for      hard economic questions.   
cultural change lay at the heart of Britain’s industrial transition, and contains the key to understanding the social distribution of the nation’s newfound wealth.

2015 Allen Restatement    -- responds to Humphries      late 18C Brits are tallest Europeans; via Cinnerella (heights) "the standard of living slipped during the second quarter of the 19th C, for the heights of the men born in that period dropped. Why this happened is not entirely clear. There are three possibil-ities.43 (Komlos: shrinking)"  decreased W via increased inequality; pollution and disease of large cities; decr rel price of manuf goods so perhaps shift away from kids food. Allen says none matter for the high-wage explanation of the Ind Rev  

      p13. The economic implications of declining heights came in the later Victorian period. The British workforce of the 1880s and 1890s was shorter than the workforce of the 1780s and 1790s. Perhaps intellectual development was also adversely affected. The decline in the quality of the work- force may have contributed to Britain’s poor productivity performance in the late nineteenth century.          ...  At the end of the eighteenth century, the geographical distribution of these attributes was not dissimilar to that  of height.45 The highest levels of literacy and numeracy were reached in Britain, the US, and the Low Countries. They were followed by north-eastern France, western Germany, and Scandinavia.                         ....   Wages, height, and literacy point to an important conclusion: the quality of childhood in eighteenth-century Britain was high in comparison to that in most other parts of the world.
 V   Underlying all of her criticisms of the high wage economy is Humphries’s view that living standards for many people were low during the industrial revolution
   p18   "The ‘standard of living question’ was the result of the liquidation of the traditional sectors that were responsible for the prosperity of the eighteenth century. The standard of living problem was big because these sectors were large.55"    16th 17th C L family could not afford "respectable" standard of living   "The situation changed between 1700 and 1775 due to the rise in spinners’ wages. In this ‘golden age’ the family earned 20 per cent more than necessary to purchase the respectability standard."   p19  but figure 6 shows how the general prosperity of the high wage economy of the eighteenth century gave way to enormous inequality as the industrial revolution unfolded. " FIG 6 shows Agric L incomes mostly the same 1770-1860 (but variable, some jumps, 1845-55?) INCREASED INEQUALITY   VI  English working class ate bread, cheese, meat (as described by Engels?) BEER?

"Lure ... Patriarchal Perspective ... " -- promising for us, for pregnant woman's caloric needs (but what of the "just buy oatmeal" alternative? )     
p695  The main criticism presented in this article  ...  begins with the claim that wages at the end of the eighteenth century were historically high and provided a living standard ‘far above bare bones subsistence’
   706  Moreover, there is good evidence to suggest that infant and  childhood mortality deteriorated in the first half of the nineteenth century, meaning that families faced the costs of bearing and at least partially raising children only to have them die before adulthood with greater frequency.55

  We revise previous estimates on average nutritional status in Britain during the industrial revolution. We find that average nutritional status declined substantially throughout the period 1740–1865, with a partial recovery only for the cohorts born in 1805–9 and 1810–14. The decline in nutritional status estimated for the second half of the eighteenth century is consistent with recent estimates of food prices and farm labour wages. We suggest that parliamentary enclosures and the decline of cottage industry could partially explain the fall in nutritional status. In addition, comparing the age at final attainment of height of a group of rural residents with a group of urban migrants we provide further evidence about the negative impact of urbanization during the early industrial revolution.

The evidence here suggests that the gains for building workers were a much more substantial 82 percent. As before with Phelps Brown and Hopkins, the reason for my much greater optimism is almost entirely that my estimated cost of living rises much less than Feinstein’s. It was not till the 1820s that real wages advanced beyond their level in the middle of the eighteenth century   p1319 Only in the 1820s did real wages begin showing robust growth. Between then and the 1860s, real-wage growth averaged 0.9 percent per year     p1320  But, nevertheless, Irish real wages rose because of the declining prices of cloth, candles, fuel, sugar, and tea

2004 Steckel "Based on a modest sample of skeletons from northern Europe, average heights fell from 173.4 centimeters in the early Middle Ages to a low of roughly 167 centimeters during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Taking the data at face value, this decline of approximately 6.4 centimeters substantially exceeds any prolonged downturns found during industrialization in several countries that have been studied. Significantly, recovery to levels achieved in the early Middle Ages was not attained until the early twentieth century.   ...   it is plausible to link the reversal of the long-term height decline with dietary improvements."

  While the debate on the causes of mortality decline ... has not been fully resolved, the basic conclusions relevant for the Std of Liv Debate are: that there was a decline in mortality, however limited it may have been quantitativey, in the narrowly defined era of the Ind Rev; that the overall rates of mortality failed to increase, even with increasing urbanization; and that there was a long time of rapidly rising income prior to the great decline observed in mortality rates.

Mokyr (1988) Is There Still Life in the Pessimist Case? YES
optimist  "a significant rise in living standards before 1850"    "significant" like 1850 to 1900, "when living standards increased indisputably."   
strong pessimists "living standards actually declined before 1850   
weak pessimists, can't reject the Ho: 1780-1850 constant living standards 

p69 For the sake of clarity I will define an optimist as someone who claims a significant rise in living standards in the period before 1850   ...    strong  pessimists, who subscribe to the view that living standards actually  declined before 1850    ...  and weak pessimists, who argue that the available evidence does not permit rejection of the hypothesis that living stan-dards remained constant between 1780 and 1850    "signifi-[p70]cant" is a reasonable standard of growth, drawn, for example, from  comparison with the period 1850 to 1900, when living standards increased indisputably.      ...  Increasingly, the period of concentration has become the years between  1815 and 1850: before that the wars, inflation, and the disruptions in  international trade make exact inferences difficult. Within Britain the  debate mostly focuses on the "lower classes," which is more or less  equivalent to the bottom two-thirds or three-quarters of the income  distribution    p71   Research in the past few years has produced considerable statistical  support for T. S. Ashton's contention that living standards began to  improve in the 1820s.3 (1954 Hayek ed.)  2-pronged L&W real wages doubled 1819-1851   Crafts finds similar real wages 1851, rising from 1780s      Mok shows that Engerman & OBrien's confidence that inequality rising did not offset pcGDP gains falters when we go with Crafts over Deane&Coale
 
    The weak pessimist case which argues that before 1850 the majority of Britons benefited little from the Industrial Revolu-tion is not yet dead. I do not wish to imply that my data restore  Hobsbawm's argument that matters were actually deteriorating, but the  improvements before the late 1840s were small compared to the second  half of the nineteenth century.

p343 the evidence suggests that poor pregnant women suffered from growing malnutri-tion because industrialization and rapid population growth progressively deepened their poverty.
p345 Thus far, the debate over standards of living has yielded enough evidence to indicate that malnutrition and development went hand in hand. If so, the case of the pessimists will have been dramatically affirmed.

Hobsbawm (1957 EHR 46-)    
p46 The debate about the standard of living under early industrialism has now continued for some thirty years.Among academic historians, in  Britain at any rate, the pendulum has swung away from the classical  view, held by enquirers and historians of all political views2 until the appear-ance of Clapham's *Economic History of Modern Britain*.  It is today heterodox to  believe that early industrialization was a catastrophe for the labouring poor of  this or other countries, let alone that their standard of living declined.
p60    It is altogether likely that living-standards improved over much of the 18th C. It is not improbable that soon after the onset of the Ind Rev ... [p61] they ceased to improved and declined. Perhaps the middle 1790s ... mark a turning-point. At the other end, the middle 1840's certainly mark a turning-point 
   sum up as follows. The classical view has been put in Sidney Webb's words: 2 'If the Chartists in 1837 had called for a comparison of their time with 1787, and had obtained a fair account of the actual social life of the working-man at the two periods, it is almost certain that they would have recorded a positive decline in the standard of life of large classes of the population.'    
2 S. Webb, Labour in the Longest Reign, Fabian Tract 75 (1897), p. 2.


Webb (1897)    
p2 If the Chartists, in 1837, had called for a comparison of their time with 1787, and had obtained a fair account of the actual social life of the ordinary working man at the two periods, it is almost certain that they would have recorded a positive de-[p4]cline in the standard of life of large classes of the population. 
 "And ... a trustworthy comparison of [1787] with 1737  ... [would show] a smilar decline. There seems reason to believe, indeed, that in 1837 some large sections of the 'dim inarticulate multitude' were struggling in the trough of a century's decline in all that makes life worth living." 
p6   1837 marks almost the lowest depth of degradation of the English rural population, and a very low level indeed in the condition of the miner and the mill operative.
p7 In comparing ourselves with 1837 we set an appallingly low standard, 

p16 It will not, I think, be generally disputed that the last sixty years have seen a very great advance in the condition of a very large part of the people. But it is essential to notice the fact that this great advance in prosperity, this great rise in the standard of life, has not been universal. There are living in our midst to-day considerable masses of people who, as regards their economic circumstances, are still in 1837.    
p17   Mr. Charles Booth ...  some 32 per cent of the whole four millions of London's population fall within his four classes of “poverty,” earning not more than a guinea per week per family. It is difficult to believe that, even in 1837, the percentage of persons at a corresponding low [p18] level can have been greater.   ...   out of this huge residuum nearly a third are actually below what can be called even full subsistence for a London family, we shall begin to feel that our boasted progress since 1837 has not, after all, taken us very far.     
p21 Out of the four millions of women who are working for wages at the present time, a very large percentage must be earning practically no better subsistence than their grandmothers did.

### Wales
Can we link higher SR2 to rural-ness?  Maybe industrial areas of Wales are blighted in 1841? [BBC site on Wales](https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/guide/ch15_industrial_revolution.shtml) identify      It was north-east Wales which developed the greatest range of industries. By the late 18th century there were 19 metalworks at Holywell and 14 potteries at Buckley; Holywell and Mold had cotton mills; lead and coal mines proliferated. Bersham, where the Wilkinson family were pioneers in the use of coke rather than charcoal in the smelting of iron, was one of Europe's leading ironworks.      
In the long term, however, the developments in the south east were more important. The ironworks of Merthyr Tydfil [a borough of Glamorgan] - Cyfarthfa and Dowlais in particular - gave rise to Wales's first industrial town. By 1830 Monmouthshire and east Glamorgan were producing half the iron exported by Britain.

p61 Perhaps the strongest body of evidence which suggests that the pattern of declining endogenous infant mortality was real comes from data that the Registrar General collected and reported in the earliest decades following the onset of a system of civil registration in 1837 for a few scattered years in the 1840s
p61  It shows that there was little change in endogenous infant mortality from 1580 to 1750 although exogenous causes rose and were almost exclusively the reason for the infant mortality rise that occurred over that period. It shows, however, a striking fall in endogenous mortality over the next 80 years by almost two-thirds 
p62  the Registrar General’s data for a number of very different communities exhibiting very different overall infant mortality all suggest that whether infant mortality was high or modest or indeed uncharacteristically low there was a level of endogenous infant mortality that was remarkably similar in all of them
p65 The late eighteenth century fall in exogenous infant mortality occurring in urban centres remains one of the unsolved mysteries of urban population history.

There is also an early reference to ‘Darwin’s law’ (p. 12).

Viazzo&Corsini1997 p xxi  although these measures were very  often used for international comparisons, they were probably not as reliable as commonlybelieved, either because ofthe quality ofthe vital registration systems orbecause of differences in the legal defrnitions of the registered events (stillbirths, late foetal births, live births, deaths)

They formed a special category in the published statistics at the beginning of the century and were often not counted in the figures for live births and infant deaths, which caused the published infant mortality frgures to be underestimated in some countries (including France and the Netherlands).
p9 The idea of combining late foetal mortality and early neonatal mortality into a single index called p erinatal mortølity goes back to an article published in 1948 in Population Studies (Peller 1948). It is around this period that the stillbirth rate began a sustained and irreversible decline all over Europe    ... <late foetal mortality> the decline started much later than the decline of infant mortality

Johansson (2005 PopSt) on Fogel ... 
[casting doubt on Fogel's view of chronic malnutriion] p248 Even now it remains conventional to assume that some part of the excess mortality of females in the nineteenth century reflects the pre- [p249] sence of chronic malnutrition among wives and daughters in low-income households, but not among their husbands and sons, except during harvest failure or famine (Alter et al. 2004).

ReidA (2002 PopSt), "Infant feeding and post neonatal mortality in Derbyshire, England, in the early twentieth century.  pp151-66.
151 The chronology of the decline of infant mortality in  England and Wales has been well established.

ABS The malign contribution of northern industrial cities to the stagnation of national life expectancy over the period 1820–1870 forms part of one of the most long-running debates in English economic history, regarding the impact of early industrialisation on living standards.   ...   We conclude (1) that any worsening of water quality in urban areas c.1800–1850 was not confined to new or rapidly growing industrial or manufacturing towns; and (2) infants probably rarely drank untreated water, so high infant or diarrhoeal mortality rates should not be read as indicators of poor water quality, in the English context.
  ATTACK SZRETER  
  life expectancy improved at the aggregate national level between 1750 and 1820, and survival rates of infants and young children rose dramatically in London and probablyin other urban centres over the same period (Davenport,2015; Landers,1993, Chapters4–5; Wrigley, Davies, Oeppen, & Schofield,1997, p. 272)    Using a mixture of scant empirical evidence and extrapolation, Szreter and Mooney (1998) argued influentially that life expectancy fell in the national population between 1820 and 1840 as a consequence of worsening conditions especially in northern indus-trial and manufacturing cities (Figure 1). 
  BUT   The higher infant and child mortality rates evident in the second half of the nineteenth century in many northern towns was probably also a feature of the first half of the century, as Szreter and Mooney argued. However it seems unlikely that this excess mortality was due to inferior water quality

  parish was chosen as a case study  ONE PARISH -- too narrow (but support OPTIMs)
By the 1860s, however, infant mortality rates in London had decreased dramatically (Landers, 1990; Schellekens, 2001), although the estimated mortality rates and the magnitude of decline in mortality over this period vary according to the method of calculation (Woods, 2006). The relative mortality of male and female infants is poorly documented in London during this important period of demographic and economic transition.
   Male infants have an inherent biological susceptibility to mortality at all ages compared with females, but this is particularly pronounced in early life. This underlying pattern of mortality, however, may be significantly influenced by infant feeding, weaning and health care behaviours for male and female infants, practices that are often socially and culturally determined (Waldron, 1983, 1987).
p117 marked decline in endogenous infant mortality, reflecting conditions
already present at birth,   Contrastingly, the reduction in total infant mortality was particularly steep between the 1790s and 1830s, despite the fact that this was a period of economic decline in the parish of Christ Church Spitalfield     ...  A plausible interpretation for these
results is that exclusive breast-feeding until the age of 3 months was widely practised in the 1830s resulting in substantially lower infant mortality in the first 3 months of life than in earlier periods.

Figure 1 shows mort decline at end 19thC .  Complicated geographic decomposition, using maps ... p791 confirms the basic snapshot pattern: Urban areas had high rates and rural areas had lower ones.   there is much to support the well-established urban story. Urban areas did indeed have high rates, they generally started to decline in the 1870s or 1880s   Urban areas   improvements were around the same as the national aggregate.   over much of the countryside, infant mortality decline started well [p792] before the 1870s  ...    This means that to understand the functioning of  the national aggregate, we must understand at least  three stories: the urban story of high rates that start  to decline in the 1870s and 1880s, the rural-core story of much larger declines starting much earlier, and the  rural-periphery story of the areas that lagged behind the  others. Within these there will clearly be many variations ...

WilliamsN & Galley (1995 PopSt), "Urban-rural differentials in infant mortality in Victorian England"

p414     ...  n24 Contrary to the views of some contemporaries - who saw high infant mortality as a result of a decline in breastfeeding, caused both by the marketing of new artificial infant foods and also the employment of mothers  outside the home - breastfeeding appears to have been widely practised, and would certainly explain why levels  of urban infant mortality in England are considerably lower than in even rural parts of Europe. For a  discussion of breastfeeding see Woods, Watterson, and Woodward, ... pp116-119.     
    
Of all infants, newborn babies were the  most vulnerable, and large numbers perished within the first week of life, in both the  town and the country. However because newborn babies tended to be breastfed, the  relative risks between town and country were dampened: breastfeeding was shielding  urban infants in particular. Once weaned, however, they were fully exposed to the germs  and pathogens of crowded and insanitary conditions, and the gap between town and  country not only widened, but persisted throughout the remaining months of infancy.

By the 1880s, over half of all infant deaths in England and Wales occurred in only 43 out of approximately 600 Registration Districts: London's share alone accounted for over 13 per cent.2  National infant mortality was increasingly being driven by the behaviour of the towns and cities.     p191   table with 1860-99 mean IMR, by town

Pre-famine Ireland:  consensus that it was poor but healthy (taller than English -- but all might be pretty short?).   
*IMR* is an unsettled issue (JRI not aware of others). Mokyr suggest 224 per K, and others suggest IMR above other Europeans. But the SR1 is inconsistent with that sort of IMR, absent mortal female-gender bias. E.g. suppose 25% infant mortality, male IMR 120% of female (for probabilities of death 272 and 227 per K), and SRB of 1.05: the SR of exact 1-yr-olds is 100.6; SR1 would be greater, because the M/F ratio is decreasing over the 0-12 month. For example, in a population with constant 25% infant mortality over the interval, SR1 would be about 103; with 2/3 of deaths in the first 3 months, SR1 moves down toward 102). Maybe IMR of 150 generates exact Yr1 SR of 102.6 so SR1 values of 103.5 would be reasonable ...

2007 OGrada overview essay in book from 2003 conference (Eh.net)   
    
     Ireland was a poor country in 1845, income per head being about half that in the rest of the United Kingdom. The regional contrast between the northeast, which was undergoing rapid industrialization at this time, and the west and the south was marked. Moreover, while there were some signs of a rise in urban and middleclass living standards, the half-century or so before the famine was aperiod of increasing impoverishment for the landless poor (Mokyr and O Grada, 1988).   ...  The nutritional content of the potato and widespread access to heating fuel in the form of turf eased  eased somewhat the poverty of Ireland's three million ‘potato people’, who were healthier and lived longer than the poor in other parts of Europe at the time. One indication of this, based on evidence from military and prison archives, is that adult Irish males from the lower end of the socio-economic scale on the eve of the famine were at least as tall as, if not taller than, their English peers (O Grada, 1991; Mokyr and O Grada, 1996). However, their poverty meant that when the potato failed, there was no trading down to a cheaper alternative food (O Grada, 1994a: 80~97).   
p55 conclusion notes "Several issues require further investigation" ... pre-famine well-being not among those. 

2004 Deborah Oxley (2004 SSH)  p279 Ulster's height advantage 
the devlopment gradient .. Ulster was the most developed, followed by Leinster and then Munster, while Connaught wasthe poorest. Deaths by starvation -- both absolute and relative to population size -- were exactly the inverse of this gradient ... (OGrada & ORourke 1997; Kennnedy et al. 1999:36-41)  Arguably, mortality was driven not by the crisis of a sudden crop failure, but by an ongoing level of destitution and enduring hardship that weakened resistance (Ô Grâda 1995: 3).


1997 Nicholas & Steckel -- JEEH publishes their 1992 NBER paper (tall but poor -- but covering 1785-1815, which they connect to M&OG?)

1996 Mokyr & OGrada (1996 EEH) p160 Yet on this evidence, it would be difficult to reject the claim that the Irish poor born between the 1780s and the 1840s were at least as tall as the English. Table 6 shows that Scottish workers were taller than either Irish or English (confirming the findings of Floud et al., 1990, pp. 202–209).  p161 m. The data fail to reveal any sustained improvement in observed height from the end of the Napoleonic Wars (birth cohorts of about 1790–1800) to the end of the 1850s (birth cohort of about 1835–1840). p163 All research thus far has pointed to a significant gap between Ireland and England in favor of the Irish, a gap that declines from the mid-18th century to the Famine. Furthermore, the Scots were generally taller than either the Irish or the English. It is reassuring here to find convict, military, and admiralty records all pointing in the same direction. Other information, too, suggests that the pre-Famine Irish were relatively tall and well fed (e.g., O´ Gra´da, 1992). We have also been able to establish that the unhealthy effects of cities seem to translate into the somewhat lower height of urban recruits, t p164 These differences prompt a final methodological reflection. The sensitivity in outcomes to the welfare measure used is partly resolved by the distinction between living standards and nutritional status. It is sometimes assumed that they are positively correlated—but the evidence suggests that this correlation is a loose one.

1996 OGrada (1996 Histoire Mesure)    p148 results indicated that Irish poverty was mitigated by a nutritious diet. p160 All work so far has pointed to a gap between Ireland and England in favour of the Irish, a gap that declines from the mid-eighteenth century to the Famine. Again, Scots were generally taller than either the Irish and the English. Even here there is cause for caution. The Irish pre-famine advantage may stem partly - and paradoxically - from the relative poverty of Ireland, since this would have induced a relatively better quality Irish recruit. While the Irish height advantage is striking and probably genuine - it survives cross-tabulations by occupation and region - these limitations of inferences based on volunteer army data must be borne in mind. In the circumstances, it is reassuring (and important) to find convict, military, and admiralty records all pointing in the same direction. Other information, too, suggests that the **pre-Famine Irish were relatively tall and well-fed**     p161 omes. The dependence on the potato and other low-value but high-calorie foods in poorer countries, and often accidental relationship between desirable and wholesome diets create lots of problems for those who would infer living standards from nutritional status alone

1994 Riggs Scotland prison -- Irish tall, but getting shorter in the 1820s 1830s


1993/1988 OGrada book ([Ireland Before and After the Famine](https://archive.org/details/irelandbeforeaft00ogra/page/n5/mode/2up)) p46 "argue tentatively in favour of 'light' child mortality" 
p6 In Erris as elsewhere, increasing population undoubtedly produced greater mass poverty.
p8 quotes Mokyr      one plausible reading of the map is that the adjustment was most radical where it was least needed. In this scenario, as explained by Joel Mokyr, "population grew unrestrained, continuously exacerbating poverty, thus making resolution of the problem by a catastrophe ultimately inevitable" n19 p43 of WhyIreSt But that is Mokyr describing test outcome 2 (Y/L falls with R/L but population is nonresponsive to income)



1989 OGrada p38 In the end, whether due to overpopulation or other factors, there is no denying the gradual decline in the living standards of the poor, the bottom half or so of the population before 1845.26 The shock of Phythophthora infestans would have had less of an impact in an economy with a larger margin to spare. (referring to M&OG 1988 EHR)

1988 Mokyr & OGrada EHR,  "Poor and Getting Poorer? Living Standards in Ireland before the Famine"  p211 The Irish poor almost certainly grew poorer during the half century or so before the Famine, but overall average incomes  probably rose. This implies a sharpening of the inequality of income distribution. (end of intro) **Irish GDP** shows increasing pcGDP (average)    p212 1/2 or more are poor.    "what proportion was considered 'poor'?  / A lower bound of three out of over eight million would include those who relied almost exclusively on the potato for food, ...  Other sources indicate a higher proportion  ... upper bound of 60 per cent or more could be defended ...  1841 census division of families into those 'depending on their own manual  labour', those who depended on 'the direction of labour', and those with 'vested means, professions, etc.'. In the country as a whole, the first category  accounted for 62.9 per cent of the total.'2 A safe middle ground would be  the lower half of the income distribution. p213 Table 1 "subjective impoverishment index"  -- (p. 211: responding to questionnaire "Is the general condition of the poorer classes in your parish improved, deteriorated, or stationary, since the peace, (1815))  p215  The results indicate a definite perceived deterioration of the condition of the poorer classes between I8I5 and i835.    p217 province of Connacht "the poorest and most backward" no tea dealers  p221  For consumers of tea, sugar, and tobacco, a net improvement in living standards was taking place.  p222  these proxies indicate that in the longer run improvement was neither  ubiquitous nor steady; the positive trend in tea, sugar, and tobacco consumption conceals long stretches of stagnation and decline, and growing inequality. Yet ironically, in the decade and a half before the Great Famine, still viewed by many as a Malthusian disaster, there is little evidence of severe pressure on living standards, as per caput consumption of tobacco shows an impressive recovery.     p223  A look at schooling and literacy patterns across the country and over time  should therefore provide us with another rough guide to the changes in  living standards p224  a slight rise of school enrolments  p225  The proportion illiterate is one-third higher for the 66-75 age bracket  than the I6-25 bracket. The difference is consistent with a gradual  improvement in literacy levels between the I780s and the i830s. p226  In sum, Ireland was something of an 'impoverished sophisticate', in the  sense that its literacy level was probably higher than its income level would  indicate.50 (Sandberg -- Sweden)  p228 it seems that, rising real wages in Britain notwithstanding, the 'backward' Irish economy did not fall behind in  nutritional status and that there was no substantial difficulty in feeding a  rapidly growing population in Ireland     ...   Nonetheless, the seemingly paradoxical finding that the Irish were as tall  as any other European nation and were possibly growing taller themselves  in a period of economic decline suggests three important points to be kept  in mind by those making use of physical indicators of living standards.  p229  The  much-feared Malthusian spectre was not much visible before i845.    life expectancy at birth of about 38 years, 40 years in contemporary England.62=Boyle & OGrada      Given that Irish infant mortality rates were about 50 per cent higher than in Britain, life expectancy at higher ages was very similar to that in Britain. Estimates of life expectancy at birth elsewhere in Europe are scarce, but we suspect that despite their poverty the Irish lived longer than the European norm.63   p230 In the years before the Famine the Irish were becoming more literate, and were probably growing taller, and they consumed somewhat larger quantities per head of desirable exotic  commodities on the market.   ... In terms of resilience to disasters, the British (p231)  economy was much stronger than the Irish;  ...  the classic pessimist case has insisted instead on a rising inequality which prevented the living standards of the 'poor' or the 'working class' from rising much. The re-integration of Ireland into the economic history of the United Kingdom does not clinch that traditional pessimist case, but it lends it some support

    The 1841 Census Commissioners noted the extensive age-heaping in the recorded figures (Lee 1968:289) and produced their own smoothed age distribution (Great Britain 1843:488-489) ... No indication of how these smoothed or "real" numbers were obtained was given, though it seems a graphical procedure was used. ... For ages 0-10, we used the smoothed age distribution produced by the (p546) Census Commissioners, ... [Wrigley & Schofield 1981 undercount of 0-4 age in 1841 census GB] Several authors, notably Tucker (1970), have also commented on the serious undercounting of children in the 0-2 age group in the 1841 Irish census.  The "real" figures prepared by the Census Commissioners correct for this. These figures are used in our analysis, "  
    
B&OG Table 2 reports "raw" and "smoothed" by age for males; their raw value (103479) is the sum of the male populations at ages 1month through 11months, reported census p488. The "smoothed" value (142481) for age 0 is 37.7% larger than the census value, and their age-1 value is 59.8% larger; their age 2 value is the same as that of the census (and older ages differ via smoothing).

For undercounting of children, Lee refers to Drake 309n4 and Lee says "The Census Commissioners themselves noted the probable under-recording of children." But Drake only notes the data could be flawed; Lee doesn't tell us where the commissioners noted under-recording ... The B&OG Working paper cites Tucker 1970 for undercounting  Irish Fertility Rates before the Famine  
    
p561 infant mortality 1821-41 male 172.9 female 135.2 (male rate 127% of female!)

Census page xlv+ discuss ages and the problem of age-heaping, but they are talking about ages like 20 25 30 35  The census pages cited (488-489) are Table VI, giving pop by month to month 12, then by each year of age from 2-years old. T**those are raw, given the pronounced age heaping.**  91page lxxxiii has the census "actual" which is the smoothed series -- But   . The monthly data are not smoothed.    

NOTE that the working paper version (Boyle & OGrada 1983) has the life tables they come up with.   Boyle & Grada (1983) Working Paper -- see the 1986 Demography paper

Tucker 1970 argues for massive undercount of kids at ages 0 and 1 (and B&OG present numbers that greatly inflate those values, but I can't figure out where they got the inflated values -- they attribute the smoothing to the commissioners, but the commissioners data don't bump up the count of under twos.)

Lee 1968:289  -- is about age heaping (not about monthly stuff).

Mokyr 1983:9  says 

     Kane (1845, pp. 400-1) reported that the average height of the Irish was 70 inches, compared to 68 5 inches for the English and 68 inches for the Belgians.    
But reading Kane, we see that he was not saying typical Irish were taller, but referring to University of Edinburgh students -- well-fed people.  p400 "when at all well fed, there is no race more perfectly developed as to physical conformation, than the inhabitants of this island." His discussion comes after saying p397 "That human labour can be obtained in this country on lower terms than almost any other in Europe, is too well known to require example.  ...  this nominal cheapness is, however, by no means necessarily economy in the final cost. A wretched man who can earn, by his exertion, but 4s or 5s a week, ... must be so ill fed, and depressed in mind, that to work, as a man should work, is beyond his power. Hence there are often seen about employments in this country a number of hands, double what would be required to do the same work, in the same time, with British labourers.

p48   land appears to have been less of a binding constraint on the Irish economy than the "overpopulation" view would have us believe. 
p53 The crude Malthusian model which sets population change as a function of economic variables is wholly inappropriate

Mokyr & OGrada (EEH 1982) cite Mokyr's IMR of 220 "50% higher than England, France, the Low Countries of Scandinavia" pretty pessimistic view, albeit some attention to "relatively well fed and healthy, though poorly clothed and housed" "leisure and children represented forms of consumption" ... but "in the first half of the 19th C there was little economic progress in Ireland"   Note they cite Mokyr as 1982 forthcoming --

Lee (1968 EHR) "Marriage and population in pre-famine Ireland" attacks Drake's (1963) take on the 1841 census and Connell's work. Important for us is pessimist view of Irish diet and health (implicitly) in the 1830s ...    

     p291 IV That the fertility of Irish wives in the i830's was much the same as among the  older-marrying Norwegians is puzzling.5 Dr Drake recognizes that this may be  simply due to faulty Irish statistics,6 {6 Ibid=Drake p. 309, n. i. The Census Commissioners themselves noted the probable under-recording of children.} but the problem nevertheless warrants a reconsideration of the nutritional value of the potato. Dr Connell's conclusion that  the diet was more than adequate assumes a daily per capita consumption of 10 lb.  of potatoes and one pint of milk. It does not take into account the two "meal  months" between the old and the new potatoes, when the labourer lived in a  state of semi-starvation, nor does it make any allowance for the worsening of the  quality of the potatoes, the watery lumper having replaced better types in the  labourers' diet by 1815. The per capita consumption of milk almost certainly de-clined in the half-century before the Famine, when the pig displaced the cow as  the cottiers' most prized possession.  It seems likely that fertility in the 1830's,  when local potato failure was endemic, and the quality of the diet at its worst were lower than a generation or two earlier.

<br>Death rates in England, France, Germany, Sweden and the United States, among other such countries, declined sharply during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Condran & Cheney 1982 NO,Not PA, just PHIL 1890-1900; Haines & Kintner 2000 YESGerm IMR fall; Schofield & Reher, 1991MAYBE; Sundin & Willner, 2009SWEDEN dunno; Vallin, 1991 in Schof). These rapid declines reinforced the attenuation of epidemic crisis mortality that had already taken place by the mid-nineteenth century, and marked the beginning of a new mortality regime characterised by lower rates and lower variability (Schofield & Reher, 1991; Vallin, 1991). p238 Death rates per 1000 in New South Wales: Sydney and Rest of NSW <br>

The decline of mortality between 1870 and 1914 was widespread in large cities across the North Atlantic economies (Costa and Kahn, 2015). The sharp reduction of mortality occurred in the U.S. (Cutler and Miller, 2005; Troesken, 1999), in Germany (Brown, 1989), and in the U.K. (Szreter, 1988) among other countries. This decline initially allowed urban mortality to reach parity with that of rural areas, which had long enjoyed a health advantage (Woods, 2003). Urban mortality then continued to fall, finally giving cities the life expectancy advantage over rural areas they currently enjoy (including in the developing world, see Bocquier et al., 2011). </p>

      Despite undeniable economic progress, child-raising conditions worsened for many French families in the second half of the 19th century (Rollet 1990, 1997). With industrialization, a growing share of the population left the countryside to swell the ranks of the urban proletariat, whose working, housing, and living conditions undermined their life expectancy. This period saw  urban mortality overtake rural mortality more than ever before. In addition, lack of time to raise their own children forced many working-class mothers to place them with nurses, which correspondingly diminished their chances of survival. This phenomenon is the main cause of the resurgence of infant mortality during the Second Empire.    ... From the late 1880s to the eve of World War II, life expectancy rose from 43 years to almost 60.  ... In particular, this was the period in which large-scale sanitation infrastructure projects were realized in the major cities—from the improvement of sewer systems to the construction of drinking-water distribution networks.

</p><p>Haines & Kintner (2000 Hi Meth) on Germany
p83 It is clear that urbanization was critical to differential mortality. In the nineteenth century, urban death rates were most often substantially higher than rural death rates because of the unfavorable effects of crowding and poor urban sanitation and housing conditions (Weber 1899, 343-67; Davis 1973; Preston and Haines 1991). For example, for Prussia in 1876177, the urban infant mortality rate was 21 percent higher than the rural rate. This differential had disappeared (and slightly reversed) by 1908-12 (Knodel 1974, 169)

<br>
<br>p6 During the latter part of the nineteenth century mortality once again began to decline ... As Vallin points out ... in most areas the mortality of children aged between 1 and 14 years declined first and most, and was followed by that of infant mortality which proved to be somewhat more resistant to change. n21 Preston has argued that the English experience analysed by McKeown was highly untypical.

p30  In this paper we shall describe secular patterns of change in income and mortality;  suggest some of the reasons why commonsense observations of the association between  income and life chances are not reflected in the secular association between them; explore some of the reasons why, however, such a relation has commonly been assumed to be the  case; and discuss some ways of thinking about the causes of disease and death that may be
 applicable to considerations of the impact of real wages and income on mortality.
p32 ss Domestic Product per man-year averaged about 1.2 per cent per annum from 1856 to
 1973. Clearly, the accelerated increase in the growth of per capita income is associated with  an accelerated decline in mortality, as well as with dramatic shifts in the location of the  population from rural to urban areas, and with significant changes in the contribution of  various diseases to mortality; a shift from epidemics to endemic infectious diseases and,  finally, to a phase characterized by chronic diseases.5

Preston (1976) p20 notes that England's mortality decline was atypical  (see S&R p6n21): "We can note at this point that the mortality changes in England and Wales between 1851-1860 and 1891-1900, carefully examined by McKeown and Record (1962), are quite exceptional" 44% decline in age-sex death rates from respiratory TB, vs normal 11-12%; and 48% vs 14% from infectious and parasitic. And Influenza, pneumonia, and bronchitis -- usually largest contributor to mortality change --  was virtually constant.

p217 It is clear that mortality risk fell during the 20th century  ... However, the 19th century remains a statistical ‘dark age’ that conceals the precise beginning of secular improvement in life expectancy (Pouyez et al., 1983, pp. 292–298 [Sagueny]; Pelletier et al., 1997 [QUE PopStudies])     ...

#### USA undercounting in census

<p>Hogan (2019 Census Bureau) 

    The fact that net undercoverage of young children has been relatively high in censuses compared with older children and adults is well documented (see Coale 1955, Siegel 1974, U.S. Census 2012a, Hogan et al. 2013, and U.S. Census Bureau 2014).

        p2022 To resolve the bias from underenumeration [of births], when the census undercounts the number of children alive at the census date, we scale the count of children in the census by estimates of the extent of underenumeration (Hacker 2013; Land et al. 1984; Preston et al. 2003).

</p><p>**Hacker (2013 SSH) **  Hacker's attempts to correct for undercount are too much of a production/construction ... layers of assumptions to try to uncover underenumeration. Much beyond scope of our research. Certainly we can dismiss the estimates based on the 1% PUMS samples (which we find highly erratic for sex-ratio values). Can we dismiss his 1900 estimates?
<br>Hacker (2013) offers estimates of the census undercounts, via the PUMS samples for 1850 1860 1870  -- which are on 1% samples.
PUMS are 1% for 1850, 1860, 1870, 1910, 1920, 1940, and defaults for 1880 10%, 1900 5%, 1930 5%  ... 
<br>p72 This article estimates age- and sex-specific net census underenumera-tion of the native-born white population in the United States for the census years 1850–70 and revises existing estimates for the census years 1880–1930 (see Coale and Zelnik 1963). It relies on the 1850–70 IPUMS samples of the US census, published census data from the 1880–1940 censuses, new esti-mates of nineteenth-century mortality, and back-projection methods to esti-mate the “true” white population by age and sex at each census.
<br>p81 The Census Bureau has produced demographic analysis estimates of census coverage since the 1960 census (Robinson et al. 1993). Kenneth C. Land, George C. Hough, and Marilyn M. McMillan (1984) have revised estimates of census coverage for the 1940 and 1950 censuses.
    <br>

          p82 This article relies on new sources and new estimates of nineteenth-century mortality to revise and extend Coale and Zelnik’s demographic analysis of census coverage in the United States. In addition to relying on published age distributions of native-born whites in the 1880–1940 censuses, it relies on age distributions generated from the 1850–70 IPUMS samples (Ruggles et al. 2010). The IPUMS has two major advantages over the published cen-sus tabulations used by Coale and Zelnik. First, native-born whites can be cross-tabulated by single years of age and sex in all IPUMS samples, includ-ing the 1850, 1860, and 1870 samples, allowing estimates of census coverage to be extended back to the 1850 census. Second, the IPUMS can be cross-tabulated by place of birth, allowing a proxy of regional census coverage to be constructed for the first time. 
           With few exceptions, discussed below, the results are based on the method detailed by Coale and Zelnik (1963).

The exercise yields as many as eight estimates of births in a given year....  In the years in which they overlapped, estimates based on female age distributions exceeded estimates based on male distributions by 4.0 percent. Based on these results and Coale and Zelnik’s analysis of the 1950 postenumeration survey, which found a 1.4 percent net undercount of females aged 15–29, births back- <86> projected from the female age distributions were inflated by 1.4 percent and births back-projected from male distributions by 5.4 percent. n9 
<br>n8 Inspection of the resulting series led Coale and Zelnik to reject the birth estimates derived from the 1890 and 1920 male distributions  ... and from 1870
<br>n9 Coale and Zelnik’s (1963: 11) analysis of the 1880–1950 censuses found that estimates of the total number of births during the period 1851–1943 that were derived from the female distributions exceeded estimates based on the male distributions by 3.0 percent, and they adjusted their projected counts accordingly

<br>QUESTION: how would fullPUMS (1850-1870) change his story?

</p><p>Robinson et al (2002 PopRPR) Demographic Analysis has served as a standard to assess coverage levels and changes in coverage in each census since 1960. In particular, DA provides an independent benchmark for assessing differences in coverage by age, sex, and race (see Siegel and Zelnik 1966; U.S. Bureau of the Census 1974, 1988; and Robinson et al. 1993 for the demographic evaluations of the 1960–1990 censuses).

The child mortality rate in the United States may have increased in the few decades preceding the Civil War but not so rapidly as to explain to a considerable extent the fall in the refined birth ratio. Other factors which may have affected the birth ratios such as the extent of underenumeration of young children and the rate of increase of yearly births tended to mask the differentials and trends in the birth ratios.     
p23  In 1850 and thereafter, the number of children under 1 was also reported but, owing partly to heavy underenumeration in this age class and partly to the desire for comparability of the ratios throughout th/e nineteenth century, most demographers have preferred to use the number of children under 5 or under 10. <NO CITES FOR UNDERENUM>      
p26 In estimating the number of births, the number of children under 5 given by, or estimated from, a census was first increased to allow for underenumeration.8 <n8 Grabill et al. refers to 1940 on; see below>

<p>**Okun**  p24 refers to Lee's use of life-tables and reverse survival ratios to estimate undercounts of 0-4 year olds. If life table says 15% of kids die, but only 5% die, then the undercounts are much overstated ... via life table, every 85 in 10-14 age group in t+10 census requires 100 kids age 0-4 in the t census ...  For 1870, Lee says 11.6% of kids (0-4) were missed.  Say Lee had 88% survivor rate and we think 94% is correct; 
he sees 100  94  and thinks there should be 106.8; 100/106.8 is 93.6% -- he'd say undercount is 6.4% .  But that is all spurious ... <BR>
If he has survivor rate of 84% and mortality is 1/3 that then we'd say no underenum. And isn't 10 year age overstated? And age 4 understated, by age-heaping?

Thompson & Whelpton (1958)  -- probably dominated by Coale & Zelnick (1963)

Grabill et al (1958) p. 409 Some enumerators began the age count with 1 year according to the Compendium of the Seventh Census, so the 1850 Census may have had more misstatements of age of infants than usual.
Jim *cannot find that point in the 1850 Compendium* (also *not* found in [Report of the Superintendent](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1850/1850d/1850d-05.pdf))

So we see 5 2-yr-olds, 11 1-yr-olds, 3 infants ... seems suspicious; let's update that?


      
p97 (Grabill or Yasuba?) To estimate the number of births, first, the number of children under 5 was increased by 5 per cent in order to allow for under¬enumeration ; the number of children aged 4-9 was left unchanged. ... In 1920 the census was less complete than usual at all ages, partly because of enumerator-recruitment problems.     
p410 In some censuses it was noted that the number of children in the first 2 years of age was much less than the numbers at ages 2, 3, and 4 , al. though fragmentary birth statistics pointed to rapidly increasing annual numbers of births . Thus, the existence of an undercount of infants was " obvious" from data on population by single years of age in some censuses taken in a time of rapid population growth . Such an undercount was noted as early as 1850, when the first tabulations of population by single years of age were made for the United States.     
Ji looks at 1900 census special report; there argument for improved age coverage in 1900, problem in 1890 due to "closest birthday", and suggestion that 1880 looks better. But all in all Ji continues to find that the key is the SR values and not the magnitudes ... (i.e. absent SR much different for the cohort 10 years on, we can relax)

#### Alter's undercounrt issue

<H3>George Alter's concern: infant undercounts</H3>

<p>If under-enumeration of infants ...

<p>We restrict attention to the US-born, and treat US-born children as a closed population in any 10-year period, assuming negligible out-migration. And we abstract from possible problems in the IPUMS coding of children as US- or foreign-born.</p>
<p>The key issue for our findings on children's sex ratios over the period 1850-1920 is the possibility that improvements in the accuracy of enumeration of children's ages generate specious changes in observed sex ratios. We find child sex-ratios circa 1900 to be more tilted toward females, in comparison to the ratios observed in censuses from 1850 to 1880 (or 1890, but we dismiss the 1890 data as flawed). There is a Literature of US demographic research suggesting underenumeration of infants in the censuses of 1850 through 1880, with the 1900 census age question eliciting a much more accurate enumeration. The possible problem we need to consider is that the observed changes in child sex ratios could reflect changes in enumeration errors rather than changes in actual sex ratios. For example, suppose actual sex ratios were constant in the period 1850 to 1900. And suppose a relative under-enumeration of female vs male infants biased child sex-ratio values toward males in the 19th-century censuses, but improvements in enumeration resulted in more accurate sex-ratio values from 1900 on. If so, the  observed shift toward girls would be an artifact of changing measurement error and not a reflection of deteriorating maternal-infant health.</p>

<br>Leonard, Beemer, Anderton (2012 Cont & Change 433-59) p433 For the United States, the evidence suggests that overall mortality may have declined in the third and early <p434> fourth quarters of the nineteenth century.[3 Costa & Steckel 1997, Ferrie 2003 (re:1850-60), Swedlund (1990); Hautaniemi, Swedlund, Anderton] However, in Massachusetts, mortality plateaued during the latter half of the nineteenth century, and not until the turn of the twentieth century did mortality begin a slow but sustained decline.[4 HSUS - no more detail?] In previous work, we have argued that high overall regional mortality was sustained by the strains of significant population growth within newly emerging urban–industrial communities.5 These strains were ultimately relieved as population growth stabilised and urban infrastructures developed, notably with the introduction of filtered water supplies and sewage systems.6 Although such improvements began after mid-century, their widespread penetration into emerging industrial cities as not completed until near the turn of the century or later, when regional mortality finally began to fall.

1857 p162 Returns Incomplete
  It is a moatter of regret, that more complete records and returns have not been secured during the whole history of registration in the State, which now covers a period of more than 16 years. A grdual improvement in some particulars, has been going on, it is true , but it is very slow. Generally speaking, the returns of marriages are the most complete of the three items, and births are more fully returned than deaths -- the most important of all.
199/p179  have examined [records] of several different cities and States of teh Union, also Eng Fr Belg Sw Nr Russ Pruss Austr Sax and other foregn countries. The facts furnished us, cover upwards of one hundred million births, show 1,073 boys to every 1,000 girls born alive. Over one million of recorded births in the United States show 1,066 boys to 1,000 girls. Mass 1845-57  1,054 boys to 1,000 girls.  The proportion of sexes at birth differs in different countries as we have stated in the Tenth Report (1851).

p163   There is evidence for believing that not very far from, but, perhaps, somewhat more than fifteen per cent of the deaths that occur annually in Mass, escape registration; and these are scattered through about half of the towns in the COmmonwealth.     ... The deficiencies in the working of the law occur chiefly in the country towns, ... 

The returns from Berkshire manifest greater defects than those from any other county.

p164  returns for the present Report are as complete as those of the last year, and we are inclined to believe they are somewhat more so.  ...   Those most likely to escpate registration are the stillbirths, and perhaps those who die at extreme infancy.

p194   ....  The First Division embraces the metropolis, which, in density of population and other particulars, differs from any other section of the State.     

p195 in the metropolis, the records are at least as complete as in any other section of the State.  ... the excellent system of registry of deaths in the city of Boston, is as complete as that of foreign countries, and that it does not appreciably fall short of the actual truth.

By the time cholera had run its course in 1849, it had killed 5,071 New Yorkers. Forty percent of the dead were Irish immigrants. Cholera was a constant presence in the city through 1854, when the disease again reached epidemic proportions, killing 2,509. It then disappeared for a dozen years.

Moreover, another cholera outbreak in 1834, coming fast on the heels of the epidemic two years before, further convinced the Common Council that potable water and cleaner streets were necessary to the health of the city.

<p>Condran & Cheney (1982 Demography) seem to tell us the data for IMR are no good before 1920; they estimate IMR by extrapolating on mortality of 1to4 year olds. Their age 1-4 mortality rate in 1900 is 61% of the 1870 value; the 1930 value is 25% of the 1900 value.

Throughout the time period from 1870 to 1930, the mortality regime in Philadelphia was characterized by crude death rates which were high and fluctuating from year to year. Some of the fluctuation may have been due to the inadequacy of the extrapolated population figures or the death register, but much can probably be explained by genuine shifts in the levels of infectious disease from one year to the next. A decline in the crude death rates occurred between 1890 and 1900. The crude death rate of 23/1000 in 1892 was not surpassed again except during the influenza epidemic of 1918

Births in Philadelphia were estimated to be approximately 30 percent underenumerat- [p100] ed in 1880, and although the exact pattern of change over time is not known, a fairly large underregistration was probably the rule for much of the time period in our analysis (Cheney, 1981). Therefore, before 1920,the 1q0 values obtained using birth registration data are certainly higher than the true 1qovalues which we are trying to estimate.  ... two other estimates of 1q0 were made by fitting C&D W and S Model Life Tables to the 4q1 values. ...  The downward shift in childhood diarrheal deaths coupled with improvements in birth registration and in the census enumeration of infants in fact produce a convergence of all four estimates of lqO in 1920 and 1930."

p4  In essence, this article argues that the tremendous catch-up growth experienced by slaves is inconsistent with Steckel’s assertion that slave birth weights, a proxy for health in utero, were incredibly low. Adaptive theories of human growth suggest that poor conditions in utero have long-lasting effects on the growth pattern of children, especially in limiting catch-up growth. Thus, it is more likely that slave children experienced relatively good conditions in utero and had higher birth weights than Steckel argued.

## Sex-Ratios and Sex-Discrimination: Testing for Excess Girl Mortality -- maybe a separate paper?

  **SR1-5 or 5-9? **^[The Indian data often does not work for SR1-based sex-discrim test. The 1891 census gives SR01 SR04 (yes, the first is part of the second) and SR59. The SR01-SR04 is mostly inconclusive, but I suspect that is because Indian SR1 is very noisy (see 1891 Appendix p. vi ([pdf 295](https://www.dropbox.com/s/18d5blekfq3wurl/India1891CensusPp247%2C295.pdf?dl=0)) ), mostly because the age-1 populations look bizarre, at just 53% the size of the age-0 populations.]   
  
Comparing a population's sex ratios in infancy and childhood (e.g. ages 1-4) offers a powerful one-sided test for extremes of gender discrimination that cause excess mortality among girls.^["extremes" because there are so many varieties of gender discrimination, and many of which would be unlikely to cause excess female mortality that would show up in population statistics] It is definitely a one-sided test, because the mere fact that the SR5 is below (or near) the SR1 does not rule out various forms of misogynstic gender-discrimination. ^[Indeed, one could imagine quite egregious patterns of discrimination against girls which would not leave a footprint in the sex-ratio evidence.]   
  (societal misogny? a term to use?)  
However, if we find a population where the SR5 is substantially greater than the SR1, we have a strong evidence of sex-discrimination that killed girls -- sex-discrimination in the form of "selective neglect" of girls, or of female infanticide more narrowly.^[The term "selective neglect" refers to "a withdrawal of care and attention ... sufficient to kill an infant or young child" (Scheper-Hughes, 1987: 14). Referring to such behavior, Lynch (2011) uses instead the term "mortal neglect", from Scheper-Hughes (1992:20,343). However, Lynch's usage does not fit well with Scheper-Hughes' concept, which is to "the mortal neglect of certain presumed-to-be-doomed babies" (1992:20). The girls who suffered from sex-selective neglect were not otherwise doomed. Indeed, recalling male infants' biological mortality disadvantage, natural mortality risks would tend to leave male babies, more than females, subject to "mortal neglect."] Absent extreme forms of misogynst gender-discrimination, the SR5 in a population will tend to be somewhat lower than the SR1, because mortality risks are "naturally" greater for boys than girls.^[Absent extremes of gender-discrimination, the sex-ratio tends to decrease with age, until women start having children. The effects will be more apparent when mortality among the young is high. Population growth would only accentuate the process of a diminishing sex-ratio with age, because population growth would tend to pump up the SR1, increasing the weight of the very young, and the very young are the most male (the effects of male-biased infant mortality showing up as age increases)]. Even allowing for well-intentioned behaviours seeking to mediate the male mortality disadvantage, it is difficult to come up with a story to generate a pattern of increasing sex-ratios with age that does not include excess female mortality from misogynisticsex-discrimination.  



Although the biological mechanisms driving sex-differences in infant mortality may be mediated by "adaptive responses" (or human agency more generally), it seems clear that biology leaves boys more vulnerable than girls to a range of diseases and hazards, so that absent sex discrimination, infant and child mortality among girls tends to be lower than among boys.    


### The Fallacy of the SR1 as a test for excess female mortality 
Recognizing a low value of the SR1 as a powerful indicator of deleterious living conditions for pregnant women and infants, it is tempting to suggest that a not-low value of the SR1 could be an indicator of gender discrimination -- if the not-low SBR is found in a population known to exist with poor living conditions and high rates of infant and fetal mortality. In a society of general material deprivation (poor nutrition, poor health, and a general lack of "the necessaries and conveniences of life"^[[Malthus 1798, Ch. 16:](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/malthus/ch16.htm) "I do not mean to enter into a philosophical discussion of what constitutes the proper happiness of man, but shall merely consider two universally acknowledged ingredients, health, and the command of the necessaries and conveniences of life.]), we expect to find the SR1 to be low -- parity perhaps. If we observe an SR1 greater than expected, we might conclude we have evidence of excess mortality of female infants. However, with a little attention to theory and evidence it becomes clear that looking for unexpectedly high SR1 values is a very weak test for excess female mortality -- a test for gender discrimination that affects relative survival prospects of girls and boys. 

Although one might be tempted to draw inferences about gender discrimination from comparisons of the SR1 (or other sex ratios for childhood), across societies and time, tests based on SR1 comparisons are weak, especially in relation to likely noise in the underlying data and uncertainties about infant mortality rates and other demographic parameters.   




#### Literature for vocab of misogynistic sex-discrimination

Lynch (2011 Hi Fam^[Lynch, K.A., 2011. Why weren’t (many) European women “missing”? Hist. Fam. 16, 250–266.]. p251 This article enters the discussion of the “missing women” question using Sen's work and the research of others on Asia to compare with evidence on the disadvantaging or even “mortal neglect” (Scheper-Hughes, 1992) of girls or the disadvantaging of women in western European society in the early modern and modern periods — roughly from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries" nineteenth centuries. Like Sen's essay, it is not concerned with “sexism” or the simple subordination of females of all ages to males. Rather, it addresses both  Rather, it addresses both the intensive disadvantaging that resulted directly in the actual deaths of females, particularly as babies or as young girls; and the disadvantaging of women later in life as evidenced by rates of mortality higher than those of men. Although the mortal neglect of babies and young girls and the disadvantaging of adolescent and mature women may appear together, they are not necessarily or inextricably intertwined. Some might argue that any kind of inequality or subordination, whether between men and women or between social classes, is bound to result in unequal chances of survival. This is doubtless true in modern settings where differential access to effective medical care can be extreme and heavy with consequences for those excluded from it. However, in historic western Europe, it is not clear that the wealthy, for example, enjoyed significantly higher life expectancies than the poor until the relatively recent past, since so much mortality was attributable to infectious disease over which medical practitioners had little control (LiviBacci, 1990). Widespread, significant variations in life expectancy at birth by social class status began to appear in the European record by the late eighteenth century, mainly in large urban settings (Bardet, 1983; Blum, Houdaille, & Lamouche, 1990; Perrenoud, 1979).


#### Selective Neglect vs Mortal Neglect
Mortal Neglect (S-H 1992)  
Selective: S-H 1987, and probably by others earlier? ...

Scheper-Hughes coins the term "mortal neglect" in her 1992 book, for a "pattern I first (and rather unfortunately) labeled "ethnoeugenic selective neglect" (Scheper-Hughes 1984 :540). Today I simply call it "mortal neglect. " 

Scheper-Hughes (1992)^[^[Nancy Scheper-Hughes, *Death Without Weeping: The Violence of Everyday Life in Brazil*, Berkeley and Los Angeles, Univ of California Press, 1992.] p. 343:

    Later, I learned that the high expectancy of death and the ability to face death with stoicism and equanimity produced patterns of nurturing that differentiated those infants thought of as "thrivers" and as "keepers" from those thought of as born "already wanting to die. " The survivors and keepers were nurtured, while the stigmatized or "doomed" infants were allowed to die a mfngua, "of neglect." Mothers sometimes stepped back and allowed nature to take its course. This pattern I first (and rather unfortunately) labeled "ethnoeugenic selective neglect" (Scheper-Hughes 1984 :540). Today I simply call it "mortal neglect. "

1992 p20 "Chapter 8  ...  also treats the subject of women's morality by examining close up the triage-based choices that women of the Alto must make; these choices lead to the mortal neglect of certain presumed-to-be-doomed babies."

Linger [review (1993 AmEthnologist)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/646234): 

    Alto women's "mortal neglect" of doomed infants -- a practice of "letting go"  characterized by seeming motherly indifference to the flight of the angel-babies, the anjinhos-- is a major topic of this book.

Scheper-Hughes (1987)^[Nancy Scheper-Hughes (editor), Child Survival: Anthropological Perspectives on the Treatment and Maltreatment of Children, Reidel, 1987.]
p7 Infanticide, incest, selective neglect have once again come into the public arena of anthropological discourse (Hausfater and Hrdy 1984; Korbin, ed. 1981; McKee 1984; Rohner 1975). 
p14

     In much of the contemporary world today the traditional practice of direct infanticide is proscribed by law, by religious authority, or both. The same end-point is reached, albeit more gradually, in the semi-covert practice of selective or "benign" neglect (Scrimshaw 1978; Cassidy 1980). A withdrawal of care and attention is generally sufficient to kill an infant or young child in poorer and tropical areas of the world, where many natural threats to child survival abound and where a constant parental vigilance is necessary to keep infants and toddlers alive. Marvin Harris (1977: 5) refers to selective neglect as passive infanticide. 

Sidenote -- Scheper-Hughes (1987) tends toward the view that infant mortality was class-based, which is about opposite to Lynch's view.    

    childhood mortality had a clear social class reference which allowed it to remain masked for many generations" ... offers a different view:  In short, the social construction of child survival as a medical problem about which something can and should be done is fairly recent.4 In many pockets of the western world up through the mid- to late-19th century childhood mortality tended to be viewed as an unfortunate but altogether predictable natural occurrence, and a 15% to 20% morality rate during the first year of life was not regarded as intolerable or unacceptable. For one thing, childhood mortality had a clear social class reference which allowed it to remain masked for many generations. The pernicious living and working conditions of the urban proletariat during the first half of the 19th century corresponded to the lack of social and medical concern for the mortality of working-class and underclass children. As Foucault writes, "It was of little importance whether these people lived or died, since their reproduction was [thought of] as something that took care of itself in any case" (1978: 126). 
She also (p 11) suggests "In rural Ireland up through the 19th century, deformed, sickly, or wasted infants were sometimes killed in the open fireplace or left exposed as "fairy children" (see Scheper-Hughes 1982: 143)."    
And p14 

    In much of the contemporary world today the traditional practice of direct infanticide is proscribed by law, by religious authority, or both. The same end-point is reached, albeit more gradually, in the semi-covert practice of selective or "benign" neglect (Scrimshaw 1978; Cassidy 1980). A withdrawal of care and attention is generally sufficient to kill an infant or young child in poorer and tropical areas of the world, where many natural threats to child survival abound and where a constant parental vigilance is necessary to keep infants and toddlers alive. Marvin Harris (1977: 5) refers to selective neglect as passive infanticide. In keeping with this view I would classify as "infanticide-tolerant" those segments of contemporary societies in North India (Miller, this volume), Mexico (Mull and Mull, this volume), and Northeast Brazil (Scheper-Hughes, this volume) in which the gradual wasting away and death of certain infants is not identified as a social problem, nor are aggressive (or public) efforts made to rescue the vulnerable children or to chastise their parents. It is important to note that passive infanticide is difficult to recognize and identify, since it rarely exists apart from other, more "natural" threats to the child's survival (infectious disease, poor sanitation, inadequate diet, etc.). In addition, passive infanticide and selective or benign neglect involve neither direct violence nor hostility toward the child. Rather, parental expressions of pity for the inadequate or supernumerary infant often predominate. Parental implication in the death of their infants involves, in this case, acts of omission, rather than acts of commission, such as failing to note or respond to signs of malnutrition, dehydration and other serious threats to survivability. Deaths from selective neglect are gradual and always compounded with other exogenous causes.

    Loss of the labor of females after marriage has been suggested as a contributing factor to "selective neglect" of female offspring, female infanticide, and a resulting imbalance in the sex ratio in some patrilineal, virilocal societies with dense populations (Scrimshaw 1978, Wyon and Gordon 1971, Miller 1981)

    Some of the strongest evidence comes from societies that greatly  favor children of one sex over the other.26 In such societies, differential  care leading to differential male-female mortality rates is not uncommon.  India provides an example of unexpectedly high female infant mortality  rates. One of the first studies to point out this differential infant mortality  in India was the Khanna study, which found that boys receive more food  and medical care than girls27 and that in the first five years of life the  female death rate was 74 per thousand per year while the male death rate  was 50.28 Finis Welch reports a similar finding in Bangladesh, where a  girl is more likely to survive in a family with more boys than girls.9

    highland Ecuador  ...  While people in the village would not  discuss this openly, several in-depth anthropological studies in the same  region indicated that female neglect or even infanticide occurred occasionally and that it was considered very important that the first child be male  ...  Differential male and female infant mortality in effect permits sex  selection: children of the desired sex may receive more attention, food,  and other resources that improve their chances for survival.31 The factor  of sex selection through differential care, no matter how unconscious,  offers the chance to influence the sex composition of the couple's living  children as no other currently practical method can.

p668 An analysis of the Act raises important questions about the relationship between law and social process, and the extent to which legislation causes or reflects social change.    
p669  The Land Act came at the end of this process. It recognised rather than caused dispossession. In certain respects the Land Act aimed to constrain further dispossession, and to set in train measures that might secure African control of the land they still retained.
p684 This point takes us to an equally difficult question. Did the Land Act destroy the African
peasantry in South Africa?

Ch 1 Introduction: The Changing History of South Africa
p1 from mid1970s historiographic revolution    
p2 central focus is on the years between the 1910s and the 1970s,    ...  As in Europe, many histories written in the early twentieth  century emphasized political events and the ‘making of the nation-state’. Such approaches pervaded many academic texts and syllabi in South Africa until the early 1980s.     
  But by the middle of the century the inadequacy of such an approach was already apparent. Clearly the key issue in South Africa was racial discrimination and the causes of systematic segregation. ...  the economic and social background to segregation and apartheid (Saunders 1988). Despite diversity, most of these writers viewed South Africa as a ‘dual economy’ with two distinct societies: a white urban and capitalist agrarian system on the one hand and a rural impoverished and stagnating African sector on the other. Apartheid was explained by the unhappy history of a virulent racism, primarily of Afrikaners, which was born on the frontier of the early Cape colony and transported inland by the Great Trek to resurface in the catastrophic National Party victory of 1948. Such arguments were the mainstay of the authoritative Oxford History of South Africa published in the late 1960s and early 1970s (Wilson and Thompson 1971).      
p3  ...  In response to the independence of Africa from colonialism a body of scholarship now focused on the internal operation of African societies, rather than seeing them as adjuncts to colonial policies. It was no longer possible to view South African history as the story of British and Afrikaner settlers and their conflicts.   
  But the South African ‘historiographical revolution’ went further than this. Indeed, the Oxford History was criticized soon after its publication by a new group of young historians, many of them South Africans studying abroad, who were influenced by a neo-Marxist, or revisionist, paradigm. They explained apartheid not by the irrational racism of a pre-industrial colonial frontier, but as the direct product of South Africa’s unique process of industrialization. Segregation, so argued the revisionists, was specifically developed to nurture early industry, particularly mining, and capitalist agriculture. Contrary to the ‘dual economy’ notion of the liberals, revisionists saw the poverty and deprivation of many Africans as an integral part of the South African industrial system. Cheap labor was the basis of this economy, and it explained much of the growth and dynamics of modern South Africa. In this argument segregation and apartheid resulted from class domination by capitalists rather than broad race domination by whites.     
  These approaches transformed understanding of the South African past. The focus now lay on early industrialization on the Rand after the 1880s rather than on the societies of the pre-industrial trekker republics and British colonies in the early nineteenth century. The nature of specific class formations in differing periods and regions came to be identified, showing that not all whites or all Africans underwent the same experiences. For instance, Afrikaner nationalism had to be consciously created in the 1930s as a means of bringing together diverse class interests. And a vibrant African peasant sector in the late nineteenth century was identified, initially responding to new market opportunities but then being destroyed by the competing needs of white farmers and urban employers for labor.      
p5  ... GENDER ANALYSIS has now greatly influenced our understanding of a wide range of historical topics, including slavery, migrant labor, the South African war, urbanization, Afrikaner nationalism, peasant farming and popular resistance (Bradford 1996; Morrell 1998).    
p7 These cultural and textual trends are now becoming much more evident and are partially reflected in the pages of the latest authoritative general history, the Cambridge History of South Africa (Hamilton, Mbenga and Ross 2010; Ross, Mager and Nasson, 2011)     
p8 Although there is a broad chronological progression throughout the book, chapters 3 and 4 emphasize differing themes which span across a wide period    
p29 (after ZULU)  By the end of the 1880s the British had effectively exerted control, either directly or through their colonies in the Cape and Natal, over a large number of African societies. They did not, however, achieve their goal of a South African Confederation. The major setback to this was Boer resistance in the Transvaal.   
p30 Indigenous independence was thus largely destroyed, but South Africa in the early 1890s was still divided into settler colonies and Boer republics.    p34 (War 1899-1902)      
p36 The point here is that the South African War and its aftermath marked the end of the protracted process of the conquest of South Africa by settler and imperial powers.    
p38 The conquest of the land was thus formalized by the Act of Union under a unitary state entrenching white political power. The impact of this process for the lives of its inhabitants is the subject of the remainder of this book.     
p43 Mining activities at Kimberley shifted from individual claims in the initial period of discoveries in the late 1860s and early 1870s to larger-scale amalgamations ... late 1870s and 1880s ... large-scale joint-stock companies backed by European finance.     
p44  In the 1880s the increasingly powerful companies went further. In an attempt to control illicit smuggling of diamonds they attempted to strip search workers leaving the mines. Strikes by white miners followed and the practice was confined to black workers. The most discriminatory device followed from this. Closed compounds were introduced, modeled initially on the compounds used by de Beers for the housing of convict labor. Although prevention of diamond smuggling was the stated reason for compounding, other important advantages to the employers were direct p45 control over workers and the wage savings that could be made by the provision of cheap accommodation and food (Turrell 1984). Initially the compounds were intended for both black and white workers. However, white workers protested strongly and backed their action through the ballot box; in elections in 1886, they outvoted a company candidate and elected a Member of Parliament who favored their interests. They were supported by the small traders and merchants of Kimberley who would lose access to their custom if closed compounding was introduced. As a result, the compounds were implemented for black migrant workers alone.      
p45  ... As Turrell (1987) has shown, it was the power of the large mining companies that made controls such as passes, contracts and closed compounds a possibility. It was also this that led to opposition by white workers and the mobilization of white racism as a means to unite and protect themselves. As a result the Kimberley labor force was racially divided by the 1880s. White workers, increasingly employed in supervisory and skilled positions, lived in the boarding houses and homes of Kimberley, a town almost entirely owned and controlled by de Beers. Black migrant workers lived in the closed compounds where living conditions were initially appalling. It was an unfortunate precedent for South Africa’s first industrial town to set.     
p46  GOLD   In order to recruit the necessary skilled labor, the mine owners had to offer relatively high wages to experienced immigrant miners who were mainly from Britain, Australia and the United States. Thus the only way that they managed to keep up profits was by using particularly cheap unskilled local labor.   
  According to the early revisionist historians, it was this cost structure that produced the migrant labor system and the color bar on the mines (see, for example, Johnstone 1976). The gold mines followed the example of Kimberley in using African unskilled migrant workers, housed in compounds, because they could be employed at low wages, sufficient only for the subsistence of single men. The full cost of keeping a family (the cost of reproduction) was met by the rural economies from which workers came and to which they returned (Wolpe 1972)   ... The compounds were not prisons. For instance, at both Kimberley and on the Rand, compound workers developed their own work ethic and means of saving wages, organized their own eating, drinking and leisure activities and developed a system of fictive kinship, which included the adoption by older and more experienced miners of younger adolescent recruits as ‘wives’.    
  Monopoly control over labor recruiting developed as large-scale companies came to dominate the industry, but this was not fully achieved until at least the 1920s (Jeeves 1985).     
p47  some unemployed Africans joined the gangs ...  gangs survived by robbing both the Johannesburg propertied classes and the migrant workers travelling home with their wages. By the 1910s, such class conflicts were endemic.  p48-49 URBAN     

p50 **Changes in the countryside**     
The early revisionists argued that migrant labor was used on the mines because it enabled employers to pay low wages. However, more recently some historians have argued that migrant labor was a sign, not of the power of a mining economy to control its workers, but of the weakness of an economic system that had largely failed to gain control over rural production. Labor migrancy also suited the needs of the workers and the rural societies from which they came, at least in its early phases.      
p51 In the case of the Tsonga, Harries (1982 and 1994) has shown that decided advantages were to be gained from migrant labor. Young men thereby obtained the means of acquiring cloth, guns and cash for bride wealth, although the chiefs retained close control over laborers and recruiters and there was increased exploitation of women, who bore the brunt of local production while men were away. Again, the bargaining power of Tsonga workers was demonstrated in 1890–1 when they abandoned the Rand after mine owners attempted to lower wages.      
In the early years of the Mineral Revolution, therefore, only some African societies provided migrant workers and they did so largely on their own terms. Others had no need or desire to be involved in mine labor. For instance, the Thlaping, who inhabited the region around Kimberley, provided very few workers for the mines until the 1880s. Higher returns were obtainable from crop production       
   From the 1880s, however, this situation changed markedly. As we have seen (pp. 21–7), the difficulty of getting labor was a major factor behind the intensification of colonial conquest and land control during this period. Colonial administrators imposed new taxes on African subjects, such as the hut tax assessed per household, which had to be paid in cash (Feinstein      
   p52 ... Locust plagues, rinderpest and drought ensured the continued flow of migrant workers in the 1890s   ... Only with further state intervention after Union and natural disasters such as drought and East Coast fever in 1911–12 were adequate African migrant labor supplies again forthcoming. Moreover, by the 1910s, African migrant workers were also being used more extensively on white-owned farms in areas such as East Griqualand, the eastern Transvaal and Natal. On the Natal sugar plantations they increasingly came to supplement the workforce after the ending of Indian indentured labor in 1911.      
   Migrant labor was not the only response of African societies to the Mineral Revolution. We have seen that one of the means of resisting wage labor was to cultivate crops for commercial production, thus raising the required cash for trading goods and colonial taxes.     
   More recent writers questioned aspects of Bundy’s argument about the emergence of an African peasantry. ... Lewis (1984) pointed out that in the Eastern Cape domestic consumption in most households declined in the second half of the nineteenth century and that impoverishment rather than prosperity was the norm. Bradford (2000a) argued that Bundy’s focus on the market production of male peasants ignores the fact that the most significant change in the countryside in this period was a shift in gender roles. Men were moving from herding to the previous female tasks of cultivation because of impoverishment caused by land shortages, famine and the devastation of colonial conquest. Beinart (1982) showed that in Pondoland (part of the Transkei) in the early twentieth century, both peasant production and migrant labor expanded together. Cattle advances p54 made by labor recruiters to household heads enabled local production to expand and it was not until the 1930s that the decline of market production led to total dependence on migrant wages.      
   p54 **KEY**  by the end of the century the mining companies realized that peasant cultivation was holding much of the labor in the countryside that they required in the towns. A barrage of legislation followed, restricting and ultimately destroying peasant production.     
   p55 by 1907 poor white populism joined white commercial farmers in opposing black peasant cultivation. Increasingly strident attacks were made on black cultivators, often marked by violence against them and the landowners who rented to them.      
   It was in this context that the Union government passed the Natives Land Act of 1913. The Act forbade the purchase or lease of land by Africans outside designated areas known as reserves. These were far removed from white-owned farms and the key areas of commercial agriculture. It thus extended the ban on African land ownership in the Free State to the majority of the Union. In addition, sharecropping was forbidden in the Free State where its existence had caused heightened poor white opposition, and labor tenants were required to provide at least ninety days of work for their landlords.     
   The long-term significance of the Act was enormous. It removed the means by which many African producers had resisted both incorporation into the migrant labor system of the mines and wage labor on the farms. For this reason it has been described as the product of the alliance of ‘gold and maize’ which the Act of Union brought to political power (Trapido 1970).     
   p56 There is no doubt that immense disruption and suffering followed the passing of the Land Act.  It was not, however, immediately enforceable throughout the Union      
 p58 In the slump of 1919–20, mine owners attempted to reduce white wages again.  ... some of the whites p59  employed in semi-skilled positions guaranteed by the Status Quo Act were replaced by cheaper African migrant workers.    The result was a general strike of white workers and the insurrection of the 1922 ‘Rand Revolt’      ... But the strikers were not only mobilized on class lines. They were also virulently opposed to black workers whom they saw as competitors, and they attacked their compounds.     
 p60    ... However, the ICU ultimately obtained most of its support from the countryside. Rural protest in the 1920s was widespread, reflecting the dislocations and class tensions which the agrarian changes of the past few decades had produced. This was a different kind of resistance from that made by Africans to colonial conquest, which we examined in the last chapter. It was rather the response to the increasing intervention of the colonial state in the reserves and growing pressure on tenants of whiteowned land.    
 Such conflicts had been evident from the 1890s. In a series of studies of the reserve territories of the Transkei and eastern Cape, Beinart and Bundy (1987) have identified changing forms of resistance as the region moved from one of a predominantly peasant or subsistence rural economy to one of dependence on migrant labor and active state intervention and control.     
 p62 1920s      
 p81 Botha’s comments were made in testimony he gave to the South African Native Affairs Commission (SANAC), appointed by Milner, which sat between 1903 and 1905. Its function was to prepare the way for Union by establishing outline policies for Africans. As Cell has shown, its major recommendations provided the first clear articulation of segregationist ideals and it was the blueprint for much of the legislation that followed Union.
 
p160   Another area of difficulty was land restoration. Legislation passed in 1994 enabled those dispossessed since the Land Act of 1913 to reclaim their p161 land. The process had huge symbolic significance for a visible reversal of past injustice although the cut-off date excluded claims from the main era of colonial dispossession and only those who could prove ownership were qualified to lodge claims, thus excluding tenants and sharecroppers who were the main victims of the 1913 Land Act.
 
 
   
**Feinstein 2005** <very much secondary source -- synthesis>   The present text is in no sense a report on further original research. It is an attempt to synthesize the information that now exists. The aim is to provide a broad overview of the character,  transformation, initial growth, and final decline of South Africa’s economy, and my interpretation of the major factors that explain these developments.     
p33 The most obvious motive for persistent conflict was that the settlers wanted the land for themselves: for pasture and, where possible, arable farming   ... Domar      
p34 answer to the Domar dilemma was not the imposition of slavery or serfdom, but closure of the escape route to free land. The more land that settlers could seize and bring under their own control, the more they could deprive Africans of any means of survival other than the sale of their labour to white farmers and other employers.     
p43 But as the prospects for farming improved, the settlers gradually increased the share of farmland under their control. It was thus not a single act of dispossession but a continuing process, which accelerated after the 1870s and reached its climax in 1913.
p46  A more detailed review of the various procedures adopted to ensure the required flow of labour to farms and mines follows in Chapter 3.     
p48  With government help, laws and practices were imposed to destroy the peasantry and create a rural proletariat. The final outcome of the whole process was that, for the African people of South Africa, land was no longer abundant; in areas they could still own, land was scarce and it was labour that was plentiful.
p55 The first was the use of taxation, mainly in the form of hut or poll taxes which could be levied on
all residents of a district irrespective of their income.    
p56 The second major and continuing legal intervention in the labour market was the enforcement of pass laws     
p59  The third mechanism to increase the supply of labour was the progressive whittling away of opportunities to farm on land designated as part of the area reserved for white ownership and occupation.   p87 Segregation was thus a complex response to the circumstances of early twentieth-century South Africa.  p88 Indeed the 1940s has now been identified as something of a ‘liberal interregnum’ when a different kind of social order was a real possibility (Dubow 2005).     
p95 Apartheid emerged as the slogan of the Gesuiwerde Nasionale Party (later renamed the Herenigde Nasionale Party (HNP)), which originated as a splinter group from Hertzog’s National Party in 1934 and captured leadership of political Afrikanerdom in the 1940s. In 1948 the HNP narrowly won power. Apartheid had been a means by which it drew voters together behind a revived Afrikaner nationalist political movement.
p97 The notion of Afrikaner nationalism had to be consciously forged rather than growing spontaneously. In this it did not differ from other nationalist movements in nineteenth-century Europe, or indeed from African nationalism in South Africa. Apartheid was an important means by which political unity was forged out of Afrikaner diversity in the 1940s.    
p281  The best introduction to the crucial, interrelated issues of dispossession of Africans, creation of a labour force for white farmers, and conditions in the African reserves, is W. Beinart, P. Delius, and S. Trapido (eds.), Putting a plough to the ground: accumulation and dispossession in rural South Africa, 1850–1930 (1986)

**Beinart 2001 **
p10  The division of ownership and possession of rural land by race in South Africa, which had deep historical roots, was formalized and consolidated in the 1913 Natives Land Act.     

p34 By the early twentieth century, African peasant families were coming under increasing economic pressure in many districts—squeezed for land on which to expand agriculture, beset by taxes, disadvantaged in markets for agricultural produce and in access to credit. Two devastating cattle diseases, rinderpest in 1896–7 and East Coast fever, which moved slowly through the country from 1904 to 1913, each killed as much as 80 per cent of the herds in some districts. The diseases were not an intended cause of colonization, though some Africans believed them to be; rather they  were part of a broader spread of new plagues consequent on more rapid mobility and international exchanges of people, plants, and animal

p35 One of the greatest ironies of early twentieth-century southern Africa was that both the country’s major industry and many rural communities favoured a system of labour mobilization in which male migrants worked for a limited period and then returned with their wages to their homes. What became a highly exploitative pattern of employment appeared initially to many Africans to be less disadvantageous than a move to town. Both parties also came to share an interest in maintaining reserved areas with inalienable or communal land tenure where Africans would be free from the threat of further dispossession

p78  suggested that mineworkers be housed with their families in separate huts so that there was no close contact between infected and noninfected workers. This idea was rejected for reasons to be discussed in chapters 6 and 7,     
Ch IV Migrant Labor and the Rural Expansion of TB, 1870-1938
p92 By 1910 this meant that several hundred thousand men a year moved back and forth between the mines and their rural homes.   ... TB infection rates among the rural African populations most heavily involved in migrant labor reached extremely high levels by the late 1920s.        
p93 Allan concluded that by the late 1920s TB infection was so rife in the Transkei and Ciskei that returning tubercular mineworkers were no longer a major health threat.    
p98 Information collected by McVicar in 1906 from other areas of the Transkei and Ciskei, such as Hershel, Tsolo, and Bizana, suggests that the rapid spread of TB was not, however, a universal phenomenon among the African populations of the eastern Cape.18     
p99 Although Basutoland appears to have been more affected by the spread of TB during this period than were the recruiting areas of Mozambique,24  the disease was still less pervasive in either Basutoland or Swaziland than in the eastern Cape. Tuberculosis in fact attracted little attention in either protectorate prior to the late 1920s      
p101 Length and frequency of contact would not appear to explain the situation in Mozambique. Mozambique workers had been traveling to various labor centers in South Africa since the 1850s.29   By the turn of
the century, tens of thousands of Mozarnbicans were working on the mines every year. Moreover, as noted above, Mozambique workers experienced high rates of TB morbidity and mortality in the mines. If intensity of contact was a critical factor in the epidemiology of TB in the rural areas of southern Africa, southern Mozambique should have been experiencing a considerable increase in TB during the early years of the century. Yet this appears not to be the case.     
p102 In this respect there is considerable evidence that overcrowded housing, though certainly not as severe as in congested urban locations and mining compounds, was indeed a growing problem in certain areas of the Ciskei and Transkei during the early years of this century.  ... hut tax ... Thus, ironically, a taxation policy designed in part to generate labor may have undermined the social reproduction of labor in Pondoland by encouraging overcrowding and the spread of tuberculosis.32   n32 (p)
p103 Overcrowding seems to have been less a feature of rural life in the recruiting areas of Mozambique during the earlier years of this century and may help explain the slower spread of TB there.     
     
p113  Declining conditions in the reserves had progressed so far as to affect the quality of mine labor. This led the Chamber of Mines to initiate several inquiries into rural conditionsThe most extensive and important of these was carried out in the Ciskei and Transkei by Dr. F. W. Fox and D. Back.58    
p115 Fox and Back estimated the infant mortality rate (IMR) for the Ciskei and Transkei to be 25 percent.67   
p117 By the mid-1930s, Fox and Back had come to two conclusions: that the diet of African families living in the Transkei and Ciskei was at best barely adequate for the maintenance of good health, and that a narrow margin of safety separated this simple, nearly inadequate diet from one bound to lead to ill-health, if long continued.78

Freund (2018) 20th C South Africa.    -- Nothing found for our study
p13 in what follows I wish specifically to pursue South Africa as it existed between the Union of 1910, after which it was essentially an independent country, and 1990, when negotiations began that created a deracialised citizenship and an inclusive democracy.    ... In what follows, a hopefully graceful understanding of developmentalism in South Africa is proposed by identifying three distinct thrusts p14 ... The first of these is usually identified with the idea of Reconstruction after the Boer War ... South Africa was effectively put together as a working operation by the British. The infrastructural and economic aspects of this process were critical to what followed in fact.    
p19  ... In 1652, the Dutch East India Company, representing perhaps the most economically advanced corner of Europe, took possession of Table Bay. In the next century and a half, Dutch p20 rule came to encompass more or less the present-day Western Cape Province. In this corner of the African continent, economic life had almost entirely hinged on the ownership of livestock plus some foraging and hunting. As a result, while an agricultural potential was there, it was almost entirely unused and the population density was thin and made thinner through devastating new disease and the violent eruption of Dutchmen armed with muskets. The older population was driven out or incorporated as servants in a context of almost total dispossession over several generations. Here a new kind of society was born and, in Marxist terms, a new mode of production emerged, eventually enveloping and overtaking what was there before.   <pr> There are probably two key features to the Cape Colony that need to be mentioned, even in this very brief summary. The first is that this was a colony attached to a global commercial system with its other main links in Asia ...

#### Missing Boys?

Jim on 2021 paper: 
    

     the twentieth-century under-five sex ratio for black children was so skewed towards girls, a ratio much lower, for example, than the sex ratios of pre-industrial European countries, remains unanswered. We suggest several possible explanations. The most likely explanation, we argue, was a preference for girls.

     p16 Although excess male mortality in the first months of life is found in all societies and historical contexts where infants of both sexes received the same quality of nurture and care, the values for the South African case are extreme. The high incidence of boys’ mortality in comparison with other world areas is most likely the consequence of, we argue, better care and nutrition received by girls during the first years of life.

Jim on WP: goofball article that largely misses the point that bad material conditions of life generate a low sex-ratio! It uses SR4 -- too much noise? We'd say look for difference of SRs?  **Table 5** uses black SR1 for SBR (data lacking) -- but key is they show the Blacks' sex ratios in 1980/84 (1980 census, presumably) rising with age -- SR1 99.4 SR04 101.0 for 1980  and SR1 98.7  SR04 101.4 for 1985/90 (either the 1985 census, or 1991).   

Francisco J. Marco-Gracia and Johan Fourie, Nov 2019 [Missing boys: Explaining South Africa’s unbalanced sex ratio, 1894-2011](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francisco_Marco-Gracia/publication/337657133_Missing_boys_Explaining_South_Africa's_unbalanced_sex_ratio_1894-2011/links/5de3a7f892851c8364583870/Missing-boys-Explaining-South-Africas-unbalanced-sex-ratio-1894-2011.pdf)
p1     When the first articles on African sex ratios were published, the (p2) Statistical Offices found very low sex ratios for the under-five populations in various countries around the continent, ... 
    They expected to find that sex ratios under five years were over 100 (more boys than girls) ... We are not the first to document this. In the Preliminary Report of the 1963 Census of Northern Rhodesia (Northern Rhodesia Government 1964: 5-6), one observer wrote: 

    In most populations more males are born than females but as male mortality is higher than female mortality there are normally more females than males in all age groups except at very young age where an excess of males can reasonably be expected. This has been true of most Western nations but it has yet to be confirmed for underdeveloped African conditions. [. . . ] It is interesting, however, to find that this peculiarity was observed in the 1962 Census of Africans in Southern Rhodesia, the 1960 Census of Tanganyika and in a recent sample survey of Swaziland. It is evident that unless there is an inherent bias in reporting sex and ages which is peculiar to Africa that accepted beliefs about the sex ratio at birth and differential mortality must be revised.
This suggests that census authorities, at least as far back as the mid-twentieth century, were aware of the missing boys of Africa. These census takers were not wrong in their initial estimations. In contrast to the rest of the world, we show, sub-Saharan countries during the twentieth century had a very low sex ratio of the under-five population, and these values are not explained by different sex ratios at birth or erroneous data.    ...  We analyse whether these extremely low values, lower than those of preindustrial and nineteenth-century Europe ... (p3) can be explained exclusively by the boysígreater likelihood of dying or if there could be other complementary factors. Our initial hypothesis is that there existed gender preferences associated with social traditions and customs that conditioned family behaviour. The existence of a preference for girls in traditional African societies, we argue, had implications for social systems (such as the prevalence of the brideprice) and for the greater number of girls than boys in the censuses.
    (p3) In this paper we argue that the important role played by women in African societies was largely responsible for the demographic pattern of gender discrimination. This research therefore provides a novel explanation for the unbalanced sex ratios based on gender preferences. Our Öndings help us not only to identify the possible causes of the anomalously low African sex ratio but also to explain several demographic and social trends in South Africaís black population today.
    THEY use UNDER-5 sex ratio -- Lesotho 1946 96.2 1966 98.1  THEY mention Garenne 2004, 2002 for Bantu low SR from Bantu genetics      p4 Our study was based on the South African censuses of 1911, 1921, 1936, 1946, 1951, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1991, 2001 and 2011. We selected these ones because of their variety of information (all of them include the black population)  ... p6  black sex ratios, which remain below 100 for almost the whole period, dropping to figures close to 90 in the Örst decades of the twentieth century.
     The biological explanation for these low sex ratios is that boys are weaker than girls during the Örst years of life (Vaupel et al. 1979; Wisser and Vaupel 2014). However, the South African sex ratios are extremely low, even in comparison with pre-industrial and nineteenth-century Europe (Mitchell 2013; Beltr·n Tapia and G·llego-MartÌnez 2017)
     In our sample of black South Africans, the low sex ratios remain almost constant from one to four years. This would suggest that no e§orts were made to reverse the e§ects of the boysíexcess mortality in the Örst months of life, which would provide further supporting evidence for our hypothesis that there was a cultural preference for girls   OUCH -- Table 5 actually displaysshows the Blacks' sex ratios in 1980/84 (1980 census, presumably)

p12 The results from the 1990s conÖrm that poor children (especially coloureds and blacks) were more likely to be stunted, and boys more than girls (Health Systems Trust 1999; Zere and McIntyre 2003; Lesiapeto et al. 2010).

     In the Registrar General's Report of births, deaths, and marriages, in 1880, for England, the male births are given as 103.6 to 100 births of girls, and the following remarks are made:—  "There are two curious facts relating to this proportion of male and female birth, neither of which has as yet received certain explanation. The first is, that the proportion of boys to girls is smaller in England and Wales than in any other European country; and the second, that the proportion has been gradually but steadily diminishing for many years past. Comparing England and Wales with other countries, we have the following figures, which give the average number of male births to 100 female births for the 10 years 1870—79, or for those years out of the 10 for which the necessary statistics are forthcoming:—  "As regards the other point, the following figures show the gradual diminution in England and Wales of male as compared with female births:

"In the proportions of the sexes in this country, strangely altered as they are, I think we see the operation of the law* recognized by European physiologists and statisticians. That law operates, it is true, to produce effects differing from those observed in Europe." 

    p52 80. In 1865 the North-West Provinces returns showed ... out of 1,000 of both sexes, according to the Census returns 536 were males, and 461 only were females, thus entirely reversing the proportion generally noticed in Europe. In speaking of this state of things I wrote as follows   ....  whatever may be the influence of climate upon the proportion of the sexes ... the great and abnormal excess of males over females in this country is attributable to the social habits of the people, which, inducing very early marriages, the difference in age between husbands and wives being always relatively greater than in Europe, tend to permit a wider play to the physiological laws which are traced in the influence of the ages of the parents on the sexes of their progeny ... <para>It is, I fear, not to be doubted that the opinions of the Hindus in regard to females, especially among the higher castes, exercise an unfavourable influence on female mortality in the earlier years of life. But this influence is quite insufficient to account for the vast difference which is found in the proportions of the sexes in this country compared with others; ...  Mr. Hume's careful inquiries go to show how small is the influence which infanticide, or mere carelessness of their female children in the earlier years of life, could exercise even in the Hindu population in reference to the proportion of the sexes. There is evidently some other cause at work to produce results which are quite exceptional as far as our present knowledge goes. That cause, I believe, is to be found in the influences to which I have called attention. In the proportions of the sexes in this country, strangely altered as they are, I think we see the operation of the law* recognized by European physiologists and statisticians.

       p52 footnote  * The law referred to is that noticed by Hofaeker and Bernouille, and has been described as follows by M. Legoyt:—" L'une des lois du mouvement de la population la mieux constateés, c'est celle du rapport des deux sexes dans les naissances. Excepté en Angleterre, ou l’on compt 109 garcons pour 100 filles, ce rapport varie, dans tous les autres Etats, entre 105 et 106, pour les naissances legitimes; pour les naissances naturelles, il n'est en moyenne que de 104. Pour les mort-nes legitimes, il atteint le chiffre considérable de 138; ce chiffre descend a 118 pour les mort-nés naturels. La supériorité numérique des naissances masculines n'est pas ausse forte dans les villes que dans l'ensemble de la population. Par example, elle est de 105 pour la France entière et seulement de 103 pour les villes; toutefois cette difference, qu'il est tres difficile d'expliquer, ne se retrouve pas dans les naissances naturelles. Le fait principal (l'excedant des naissances masculines) est ègalement un de ces secrets que la nature ne parait pas dispossee a livrer aux investigations de la science. L'explication propossée par Ch. Bernouilli est la plus spécieuse. Dans l'opinion de ce savant, le rapport des garcons aux filles serait déterminé pas l'âge relatif des parents. Si le père est plus jeune ou du mâme âge que la mère, ce rapport sera plus petit que l'unité; il s'elevera avec l'age du père. Si les deux époux sont jeuties, il sera plus grand que s'ils sont d'un âge moyen, mais beaucoup plus faible que s'ils sont d'un age relativement avancé. L'exactitude de cette theorie ne peut être démontrée que pas des recherches faites sur une vast échelle." As Mr. Baines has remarked (p. 62 of Vol. 1. Bombay Report for 1881), "I am inclined to surmise, though with extreme diffidence as to the value of the supposition, that the influence of age as a factor in the determination of the sex of the child, amounts to a tendency only, varying in intensity with the difference between the ages of the parents.    ... <footnote ends on p53 with diminution of m/f SRB from 1856-60 104.6 to 1876-80 103.8

         p53 81. At the next Census of 1872 there was still a very marked excess of males in the North-West Provinces. The excess, however, was not quite so large as at the preceding enumeration. ... At the Census of 1872 the figures for other pro- vinces, especially Bengal, ... pointed to the conclusion that our enumeration, so far as the females of the province were concerned, had been decidedly defective.

     p54  82.    ...  I felt myself driven to one of two conclusions. Either the disparity between the sexes noted at each successive enumeration in the North-West Provinces was a fact, and if so, was mainly attributable to female infanticide, and to the general disregard of female life; or that disparity was not either wholly, or even in part, the fact, but was due to a persistent concealment of females, and to defective enumeration of this sex. There were unquestionably facts disclosed in the special infanticide reports which seemed to bear out the conclusion that a portion of this disparity had been occasioned by female infanticide; but this was a cause which could only have effected a very small part of the defect noticeable when the two sexes were compared, and an examination of the age returns of the Census of 1872 showed that there had been a uniform concealment of females, especially between the ages of 10 and 13. It seemed indeed that a portion of the females between 10 and 15, or perhaps between 8 and 15, had altogether escaped the enumerators, and that the actual disproportion between the sexes, though it might exist to some extent, and to what extent it was impossible then to say, was not anything like so great as had hitherto been portrayed by the census statistics         

83. Plowden quotes Cornish in Madras report, "but the nearer we approach to accuracy in the Census of a general population, the more clearly does the fact appear that there is nothing peculiar in this country in theproportion of the sexes; that if there are from 104 to 106 females to every hundred males in Europe, this proportion also obtains in India, that is in all parts of thecountry where female infanticide is unknown.  ... enumerators / obtuse ... the low estimation in which females are held in this country ... The birth or death of a female child is considered such an insignificant matter, .. that a great number escape registration ...  But in districts where the Census work was well done it will be found that the female population is invariably in excess of the male; in fact, the general accuracy of the results of any district may be judged of by the way in which the proportions of the sexes have been recorded
     
From 1881 census (Plowden p. 54)   
    the actual disproportion between the sexes, though it might exist to some extent, and to what extent it was impossible then to say, was not anything like so great as had hitherto been portrayed by the census statistics.
 ... the nearer we approach to accuracy in the Census of a general population, the more clearly does the fact appear that there is nothing peculiar in this country in the proportion of the sexes; that if there are from 104 to 106 females to every hundred males in Europe, this proportion also obtains in India, that is in all parts of the country where female infanticide is unknown. The truth is that the great bulk of enumerators have been singularly obtuse in comprehending the fact that the counting of females was a matter of any importance in census work. To understand how this is, we must take into account **the low estimation in which females are held in this country,** and also the reticence of the people on all matters connected with their female relatives. In the registration of births and deaths the same error obtains. **The birth or death of a female child is considered such an insignificant matter,** especially among the lower classes of the population, that a great number escape registration in certain districts; and, from the causes adverted, to the numbering of the female population in 1871 was undoubtedly erroneous in so far that many were omitted in the Census schedules. But in districts where the Census work was well done it will be found that the female population is invariably in excess of the male; in fact, the general accuracy of the results of any district may be judged of by the way in which the proportions of the sexes have been recorded."

p60  ... 87. In addition to the numbers of females who are short counted in the enumeration, we also have to consider the defect in the number of the sex occasioned by the practice of female infanticide. Though that practice, we may assume, has not had any very serious effect upon the proportions of the sexes throughout, yet it is unquestionable that it has had an effect which is perceptible.

p62  91.  ... quote Mr. Drysdale on Central Provinces :  p63  "It is a matter of congratulation that there is nothing in the statistics to suggest any apprehension of infanticide"

p63  93. For the Punjab, where the disproportion of the sexes is more marked than in any other part of India, and where it assumes dimensions which are peculiar even in the north, the Report, so far as it has reached me for that province, does not contain any remarks on this subject, and I am unable, therefore, to state whether the local officers have come to any such conclusions as these to which the figures have led the reviewers in the Madras and North-Western Provinces; but an examination of the figures for the Punjab certainly bears out the line of argument which has been adopted by Mr. McIver and by Mr. White, following in the steps of Dr. Cornish in the same direction.

<McIver is Madras reporter; White for NW province>

p109  147.  ... The practice of infanticide does not exist, nor has it ever obtained a footing in the country. Children of both sexes are treated alike, but Coorgs, like other Hindoo races, have a weakness for male issue, which may probably be attributed to the great expense attending the marriages of their daughters ... 


p178  It is obvious that a wave of infecundity has during the last few years swept over at least Northern India, and that the five years between 1876 and 1881 have seen a far smaller number of births than took place between 1871 and 1875.

EXTRACTS FROM THE BENGAL AND PUNJAB CENSUS REPORTS ON THE AGE STATISTICS OF THOSE PROVINCES       


pdf157 p xxxii   THE PROPORTIONS OF THE SEXES.    
*Sex Statistics in the Punjáb*.—Figures showing the sex statistics for each religion and all religions in each district and State, separately for urban, rural, and total population will be found in Table IV. of Appendices A. and B.* The proportion of the sexes has always been a burning question in India, partly because the great excess of males has puzzled statisticians: but still more because of the greater or less prevalence of the custom of female infanticide against which Government had set its face. The general result is that in the Punjáb taken as a whole, there are 5,425 males and 4.575 females among every 10,000 of the population, figures which became 5,421 and 4,579 if immigrants be excluded. It is this large excess of males, in face of the fact that in Europe the females are slightly in excess, that has to be accounted for. So far as the excess is real, and not due to defective enumeration, it may be due to any or all of three causes, excess of male births, female infanticide, or greater female mortality. These points will be discussed presently. [2 minor contributors: male in-migration to Punjab and under-enumeration of fems]

table of f/m by region and religion -- Sikhs stand out! 0-5 83.9  OUCH -- Punjab province 94.5


p xxxiv
 I have already pointed out that the excess of males in the Punjab must be due to any or all of three causes, a smaller proportion of female births, female infanticide, and excessive female mortality. Now the Inspector-General of Police in the North-West Provinces, whose special attention has been paid to the subject of infanticide, writes to me: "It is generally held that infanticide is not practised after the age of one year, that is that death is not actively accomplished; but female children are allowed to perish of inanition and inattention up to the age of three years."
     Now in European countries at least the mortality in the earlier years of infancy is tar greater for males than for females ... We should, therefore, expect to find the proportion of females steadily rise during the first few years of life, if the same rule obtains in the Punjáb; and as a fact taking the Province as a whole, we find that it is so, the proportion for the first three years being 950, 954, and 966, though I shall presently show that, other causes may affect the figures. Thus if only natural causes have been at work our proportion of females derived from the figures for infants of under one year of age is probably larger than the proportion of female births or the mortality within the year has reduced the number of males more largely than the number of females.     
      ...  If a lower degree of fecundity is accompanied by a higher proportion of male births, then the excess of male births in the Punjáb is explained, in part at least, for we have already seen that the number of births per 100 wives of child-bearing age is far smaller in the Punjáb than in England. ...    
If then the condition which impairs fecundity also reduce the proportion of female births, we should expect to find that proportion far lower in the Punjáb than in England   ...      

     It must, however, be borne: in mind that there is another possible explanation for the small proportion of female infants in years of distress. Whether or no female infanticide prevails in the Punjáb to any considerable extent, and I believe it does not, there can be no doubt whatever that the female is less welcome and less cared for than the male infant. Now this, perhaps, almost unconscious depreciation of female child life would tell most severely against the female children in years when even the male children must suffer; and it is probable that this depreciation has not been without its effect on the figures. How far the small proportion of female infants in years of want is due to this cause, and how far to an actual decrease of female as compared with male births, I am wholly without the means of judging.                
     The figures for religion do not call for detailed examination. Two points, however, stand out most prominently, and are exceedingly difficult of explanation. I mean the small proportion of females among Sikhs and the large proportion among Buddhists. In discussing the figures for Sikh females <p xxxv> ... It will hardly be suggested that a male baby in arms will be returned as Sikh while a female infant will be returned as Hindoo. Nor do I see any other explanation, unless it be that Sikhs either practise or have in former generations been wont to practise infanticide to an extent which has never even been dreamed of. To reduce their proportion of females from 948, the average of all religions, to 864, they must kill 9 per cent, of their female children, a supposition which it hardly seems possible should be true. It does not appear that there is any great inaccuracy in the figures, for a reference to Abstract No. 120, will show that the proportion remains fairly constant throughout all the age periods. 
     
The second striking fact is the extraordinarily large proportion of females among Buddhists. 
 
          p xxxvii <bottom> Is Infanticide practised in the Punjáb?—We come then to the question whether, and if at all to what degree females infanticide is practised in the Punjáb.  Now I have shown that in the North-West <p xxxviii> Provinces infanticide proper is believed not to be practised except immediately after birth, while death by intentional inattention is not caused after the third year of age. Thus the effects o£ infanticide should appear in the first three years of age, and especially in the first.    ... I believe that female infanticide is, taking the population of the Punjáb as a whole, practically unknown.

      <p xxxxix quoting "Mr. Frizelle ... writing from Shahpur">  No doubt female children are little prized and more neglected than male, but hardly more so than married women or female adults, who are very valuable; and there is nothing in the social condition or traditions of the people to cause them by wilful neglect to try to get rid of their female offspring.
      
      
    xli   ...  an intelligent Hindoo, B. A.: 'Infanticide has vanished, but female children are not so much loved as boys, because boys are the props of a family, girls are its weakness, causing expense and returning no income       "As I have remarked above, there is, I think, some indication given in the statistics of the existence of a certain popular depreciation of female child life."     
    
    Conclusion as to the Prevalence of Infanticide.—This last sentence appears to me exactly to express the existing state of affairs. That infanticide is practised at all generally I do not believe; that it is habitual with any class I doubt; and if with any, it is I think only with some exceedingly limited sections of the community, such as Gurdaspore, and even there takes the form of intentional neglect rather than actual murder. But there is not the slightest doubt that the life of a girl is less valued and worse cared for than that of a boy, chiefly indeed among the anoterogainous clans who cannot find husbands for them, and the higher castes of the eastern Punjáb who will not sell their daughters, and among the Hindoos who spend much money on their marriage and account it is shameful to leave them unmarried; but also in a less degree and as a relic of the old fighting days, and perhaps from the contagion of Hindoo ideas, among all other classes of the Punjáb people without distinction of race, religion, or locality.

These contrasting observations – boys are more biologically vulnerable and girls more socially vulnerable – suggest that rather than viewing one sex or the other at greater risk for stunting, understanding how the biological mechanisms contributing to vulnerability interact with social and cultural factors contributing to differential nutritional or environmental exposures is critical for identifying which children are most at risk for growth faltering.


Janaina Calu Costa [2021 Paediatr Perinat Epid](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppe.12763)

The study of gender bias in child health is affected by the greater biological vulnerability of boys compared to girls; in societies where there is no evidence of discrimination, boys show higher mortality rates than girls [4,5]. 
Under circumstances where boys and girls are equally valued and health care is evenly available to both sexes, boys have higher mortality rates than girls due to biological differences.1, 2, 5 The expected sex ratio in under-five mortality rates (U5MR), however, varies geographically according to the causes and overall levels of mortality.6, 7
The survival advantage of girls becomes more evident as overall mortality falls because perinatal causes and malformations, which represent the leading causes of death when mortality is low, predominate among male infants.7-9 Nonetheless, in some countries and regions, girls are dying more often than expected and present similar or even higher mortality rates as their male counterparts, thus lowering the observed sex ratios.7 Where sex ratios in mortality deviate from the expected due to higher female mortality, gender bias must be considered as an underlying cause.

DeBow 1850 Census compendium p. 101,    
A writer in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences for July, 1854, remarks that nine months after the prevalence of cholera in Philadelphia there was a remarkable diminution in the proportion of male births, and that subsequent investigations lead to the conclusion that disease, exhausting labor, meagre diet, impure air, intemperance, and other social evils exert depressing influences upon the number of male births. [2021.11 Ji notices] 

July 1854 AMJMS [The American journal of the medical sciences. v.28 1854.](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x030533591&view=page&seq=167&skin=2021&q1=Philadelphia) ...

p166 In a short paper published in July , 1848, upon the "Proportions of the Sexes at Birth" (1 See the American Journal of the Medical Sciences, vol. xxxi. p. 78) <p167> we endeavoured to assign the causes which operated in changing the ratios subsisting between the males and females . We were led to this inquiry by an accidental discovery made whilst examining the Phila delphia bills of mortality , namely , that nine months after the prevalence of Asiatic Cholera in the city , there was a remarkable diminution in the propor tion of male births — so much so as even to give a preponderance to the females . Subsequent investigations of the operation of this and other causes which we found operative in determining the proportions of the sexes at birth , led us to the conclusion that disease , exhausting labour , meagre diet , impure air , intem perance , and other social evils , exert depressing influences which manifest themselves in diminishing the proportion of male births , and favouring the preponderance of females ; whilst , on the contrary , every agency operating in a community to produce and maintain a high state of physical health and energy , leads to an increase in the proportion of male births . In many parts of Europe , where so many of the people are over - worked and under - fed , the excess of male births is very small . Throughout France and Prussia , it is usually about six per cent . , and in England about five per cent . for the whole population    ... In fact , we regard the increased proportion of males over females at birth , as a sure index of the physical ad vantages enjoyed by the population in which the births took place .

These observational studies lead to inconsistent findings regarding whether poor maternal nutritional conditions reduce the proportion of male births among human. One possible explanation for the inconsistent results is omitted variable bias.     ....     
p2888 That the abrupt decline in the proportion of male births first occurred to those who were conceived more than half a year after the famine began suggests that the earlier studies based on the Dutch Hunger Winter and Leningrad Siege failed to recover consistent evidence regarding the relationship between maternal famine exposure and offspring sex ratio at birth because the duration of the famines was insufficient.

Cites Waldron to back up nice summary statement of infant-female survival advantage:    

      Equity in survival between females and males does not imply equal mortality rates (that is, male-to-female ratios equal to 100). Under circumstances where boys and girls have the same access to resources such as food and medical care, boys have higher mortality rates than girls during childhood, and the examined ratios would overall be expected to be greater than 100.
And she continues, explaining the bio advantage.^[Newborn girls have a biological advantage in survival over newborn boys, with lesser vulnerability to perinatal conditions (including birth trauma, intrauterine hypoxia and birth asphyxia, prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal tetanus), congenital anomalies, and such infectious diseases as intestinal infections and lower respiratory infections [4]. However, beyond early infancy, girls do not enjoy the same advantage in relation to certain infectious diseases, which are the primary causes of death in later infancy and early childhood in settings where overall mortality is high [5],[6]. Thus, the sex ratio of child mortality (that is, mortality at ages 1–4 y) is generally lower than the sex ratio of infant mortality (Figure 1).]   And has useful statement re: missing women^[Earlier studies have found numerous countries in many regions of the world, particularly southern Asia, eastern Asia, and northern Africa/western Asia, where mortality at ages 1–4 y was higher for girls than for boys [1],[10],[11]. India and China in particular have a long-documented history of female disadvantage in mortality that is covered in an extensive literature [12]–[25].]

"Obviously, the closer to conception, the lower the replacement cost of terminated offspring.

MIXED FINDINGS FOR OUR VIEW (some are nonsupportive, not falsifying -- they get a reduced SBR via high-carbo low-sat-fat diet)
 In particular, a diet high in saturated fats but low in carbohydrate leads to the birth of significantly more male than female offspring in mature laboratory mice, whereas when calories are supplied mainly in the form of carbohydrate rather than fat, daughters predominate. As the diets fed to the mice in these experiments were nutritionally complete and because litter sizes did not differ between treatments, dietary inadequacy seems not to be the cause for sex-ratio distortion.      
     Large ruminants
The prediction that females in better body condition would produce more male than female progeny has been observed in red deer [14, 22, 23], roe deer [24], mature ewes [25], reindeer [26], Barbary sheep [27], domestic pigs [28], and a number of other species, although there are exceptions [13, 29]. Dairy cows, but not heifers, on a high plane of nutrition give birth to proportionately more bull than female calves than cows on a poorer diet [30]. Repeat breeder cows, i.e., ones that have problems becoming pregnant by artificial insemination, also tend to produce more males [31]. The data on roe deer [24] were obtained with farmed animals on a diet controlled for low- and high-energy intake by varying the oil content. In that study, 75% of the calves born to the high-energy does were male, while the low-energy group produced only 46% males. Most other studies have been performed on wild populations, which are less well-controlled.

Jongbloet attacks -- This runs parallel with optimization of the ovulatory and conception pattern, as argued extensively elsewhere (Jongbloet, 2004a,b), e.g. in ameliorating socio-economic conditions, during prime reproductive age and prime ovulatory seasons, optimal restoration of the post-partum ovulatory pattern, etc. In contrast, male-biased conceptuses occur in the less optimal conditions, while SSR reduction occurs only in extremely unfavourable conditions, and only then as a consequence of inappropriate implantation and perishing male-biased pathological fetuses    .... Analogous SSR reversal associated with reduction in fertility is also elicited by other severe population stressors, such as a bombing attack in Croatia 
Cagnacci replies ... Italy and Black USA evidence "probably indicates .. that the sex ratio increases with amelioration of caloric availability and reduction of undernutrition"<br>
Cagnacci, Renzi, Arangino, Alessandrini, Volpe (2003 Hu Repro), oddball piece.

Credibility impaired by citing Calle et al. BMI thing for males are more frail.<br>
Jongbloet attacks ... "The conclusion of Cagnacci et al. (2003) that more males than females are conceived in seasons with more favourable reproductive conditions challenges the well‐known V‐shaped probability of delivering more male offspring at both the onset and the end of the fertile window, versus equal gender proportions at the time of ovulation in the mid‐cycle (Guerrero, 1974; Harlap, 1979; James, 1996)."  ... but for us, concludes OK:  "in the most constrained conditions, the SR becomes inverted due to excessive loss of male‐biased (pathological) fetuses."<br>

Summary It has been  shown  about  that  50  out of  80 values  of  the sex ratios  of  births registered  during   1949-1958  in  76 ter-ritories  reputed  to  have  relatively com-plete  vital  registration   fall  within  the usually  stated  limits  of  104-107.  Among the  23 values of sex ratios at birth  below 104,  15 pertain  to populations with more than  one-third  of  the total  classified  as negro,  black  or African,  and colored or mixed. In  the light  of  other  historical evidence on the sex ratio at birth  among the  negroid  populations,  one is  led to conclude  that  there  operates, among the negroid  populations,  some genetic  or ra-cial factor  making for a slightly lower sexratio  at  birth  than  among  the non-negroid  populations.

"The sex ratio is shown to be significantly and positively associated with socio-economic variables. ...  ‘diminishing returns’ ...

**Teitelbaum (1970 JBiosocSci)** [Factors affecting the sex ratio in large populations](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021932000023476). Useful for recap of previous research. 
Gives long list of factors checked for SRB effects ... "socio-economic status and conditions" are among a long list (32 or more). <br>
p66 finds birth-order effect and race effect  BUT "An important question still remained, however. It was whether either the birth-order effect or the race effect itself could derive from a socio-economic effect for which control could not be provided in the vital data being used. [next is section called <br>
**Socio-economic effects on sex ratio** <br>
Winston (1931), Crew (1948), Russell (1936) (FIND 1921 Reg-Gen DATA), Lawrence (1941). <br>
Crew (1948) extended this proposition from the family to the community level, arguing that if a socio-economic effect is at work, rich communities would be expected to exhibit higher live-birth sex ratios than poor communities.    <br>

In contrast to the above reports, Martin (1948) was unable to find any significant relationship between sex ratio and the socio-economic conditions of the community. He pointed out that there was no apparent upward trend in the sex ratio over the past 100 years in Britain, despite sharp improvements in socioeconomic conditions over that period.  <br>
Bernstein (1948, 1954) higher SRB in upper social strata, and for males in masculine occupations. <br> 
But studies fail to control for birth order or race.  <br>
p68 children born to families in the lowest Socio-economic Index category [Duncan 1961] had approx 8-9% lower odds of being a male than those born to families in the moderate and higher Soc-ec Index categories. [eg 98 vs 106]   ... <br>
If, for example, the mechanism by which socio-economic status affects sex ratio is that of differing standards of nutrition, general health and pre-natal care, we might expect a 'diminishing returns' phenomenon—a limit beyond which 'improvements' in these factors would not be biologically meaningful. A lower-middle-class woman with normal standards of nutrition, health and medical care may be, biologically speaking, no worse off than a wealthy woman attended by the most expensive private specialists. A poor woman would certainly be worse off than both in the United States, where medical care is generally arranged on a private financial basis.
p69 To summarize the findings presented here, only three of the five factors studied appear to be independently related to the sex ratio at birth. The significant negative birth-order effect, which in the first analysis accounted for a 2-6% shift in the relative odds of male birth, remained significant when adjustment for the race effect was provided in the second analysis. The magnitude of the effect was diminished by this adjustment, however, indicating that analysis for birth-order effects in the absence of adjustment for the race factor may lead to over-estimates of the importance of the birth-order factor.

Answers yes. Useful for Savorgnan (1936)who connects SBR to female health p287 As Gini and Savorgnan have pointed out, there is no evidence that a correlation exists between the quantity of nutriment and sex at birth [that in context of malnutrition of mothers claimed to raise SBR in wartime]   p288  Fifth, the most reasonable hypothesis is that of Savorgnan, who  has made the most complete study of the masculinity phenomenon.  This may be called the birth-interval hypothesis. Briefly stated,  Savorgnan maintains that masculinity in births increases in war-time on account of the greater intervals between births, which, in  turn, produces greater rest in the female reproductive system and  thereby brings about the birth of a larger number of males. ...   But how do greater intervals influence the rate of male births?  Savorgnan replies, by producing more prolonged rest and recovery  in the female reproductive organism, which, in turn, reduces the  rate of abortions and stillbirths; and since the proportion of males  in abortions and stillbirths is always higher than that of females, [p289]  the reduction of abortions and stillbirths increases the proportion of males actually born. The effect of stillbirths and abortions in  reducing the rate of male births is well-established in some coun-tries, especially in Germany and Hungary    p920 counterexamples from Egypt and India high SBR and high frequency birth  <br>

LawrencePS (1941 QRBio) p54 "Punnett (1904), who studied the sex ratio in poor and wealthy classes in London concluded that a low masculinity was associated with low social status"  p55 The bulk of the writings indicate that in a general population a high social and economic status is accompanied by a greater proportion of male births than is a low status. Also rural areas demonstrate a higher masculinity than urban districts, at least with respect to European countries. It is quite probable that part of the variation has its basis in differential rates of prenatal mortality, as has frequently been maintained. Bertillon (I875), Alberti (1934), and Taussig (1936) demonstrated that the incidence of reproductive wastage is higher for urban than for rural populations, and thus lend support to this explanation. These studies pertain to Euro data"  Ciocco differ?

Lenz looks at the correlation between the ratio of male to female mortality rates and "the rate of mortality on both sexes in 11 series of annual rates of mortality for different countries (in most cases the number of years included is very small, 8 or 10, in only one does it exceed 40) and he finds that in the great majority the value of r is large and negative."

p262 Of the various factors which have from time to time been brought forward to account for the determination of sex, that of nutrition appears to have found most favour. That favourable nutritive conditions tend to produce females, and unfavourable conditions males is a hypothesis which has received much support from observation and experiment on numerous forms of life 1 . In the case of the human species, however, strong evidence for or against this view is yet a desideratum. [NOTE: prevailing presumption was better nutrition would reduce the SRB! N1 is Geddes and Thomson, [*Evolution of Sex*](https://archive.org/details/evolutionsex01geddgoog/page/n5/mode/2up), pp. 41-47]<br>
p276 Summary and Conclusion <br>
If the population of London be divided into three portions exhibiting graduated poverty it is found that the proportion of MAL to FEM infants produced is lowest in the poorest portion, highest in the wealthiest portion, and intermediate in the intermediate portion. The proportion of MALs is highest of all in a number of births taken from Burkes Peerage, where the nutrition may be supposed to be of the best. From this the alternative conclusions may be drawn : that either more favourable conditions of nutrition (1) may result in a large proportion of MAL births, or (2) may have no effect on the proportion of the sexes, or (3) may even result in a relative preponderance of FEM births, but that in the last two cases the effect is masked by other factors which affect unequally the different strata of society. Such factors are shewn to exist in a differential infant mortality, a differential birth-rate, and probably also in a differential marriage-age. These factors all tend to diminish the proportion of MALs in the poorer portions of the population, and consequently render the first of the above alternative conclusions improbable. Whether the second or third of the other possible conclusions is to be accepted must remain doubtful so long as we are not in a position to estimate the quantitative effect of the factors given above. From the necessarily rough estimate which he has been able to form, the writer's opinion is that their combined effect would not be sufficiently great to mask a preponderance of FEM births due to better nutrition, and consequently he is inclined to believe that in man at any rate the determination of sex is independent of parental nutrition 1  <br>

There are two other SBR papers with Ethiopia Gibson & Mace (2003 PrRoyalSocBiol) (who happen to say "There is some evidence that male foetuses are more susceptible to exposure to toxic substances, but results on the effect of maternal nutritional condition on sex ratio are inconclusive (Lazarus 2002).)" **Is that BS?**  Hohmann & Garenne (2010 EcoHuBio c17) look at wealth, child and adult mortality in Uzbezistan and sub-Saharan Africa.

Known and hypothesized risk factors for reduced sex ratio at birth and in fetal deaths cannot account fully for recent trends or racial or national differences. Whether avoidable environmental or other factors—such as widespread exposure to metalloestrogens or other known or suspected endocrine-disrupting materials, changes in parental age, obesity, assisted reproduction, or nutrition—may account for some of these patterns is a matter that merits serious concern. **NUTRITION**   SRB 1970-99 Japan falls 1.071 to 1.055  US whites falls 105.9 to 105.0 (blacks increase from 103.1 to 103.2 ) fetal deaths per K in 1999 Japan 31.6  in US  6.7  In Japan the proportion of fetal deaths has jumped from 56% in the early 1960s to 67.7% in 1999.

The sex ratios for individual API subgroups varied considerably, however, from a high of 1,092 for Chinese mothers to a comparatively low 1,000 (equal numbers of male and female births) for Hawaiian mothers. As in previous years, the sex ratio for all Hispanic mothers (1,038) was about midway between non-Hispanic white (1,051) and non-Hispanic black (1,032).

This number represents 826 fewer infant deaths in 2017 than in 2016. The ratio of male to female infant mortality rates was 1.2, the same as in 2016. The infant mortality rate was 5.79 per 1,000 live births, the neonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants aged 0–27 days per 1,000 live births) was 3.84, and the postneonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants aged 28 days through 11 months per 1,000 live births) was 1.95 in 2017 (Tables C and 13; Figure 7; see Technical Notes for information on alternative data sources). Changes in the infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality rates from 2016 to 2017 were not significant.

In contrast to the situation at the turn of the century, when infant mor-tality rates were ofthe order of 150 or more, a number of western European countries today have single-digit infant mortality rates; and in three countries (Finland, Iceland, and Sweden), out of every 1,000 babies born only 6 fail to survive until their first birthdays (Population Reference Bureau 1989). In addition, an infant mortality rate of less than 6 per 1,000 is found in Japan, the first non-European coun-try to achieve a high level of modernization. In sharp contrast to these single-digit infant mor-tality rates, or even those approaching 15 through-out more or less developed regions of the globe, in-fant mortality rates of the order of 100 or more per 1,000 live births are still fairly common in the less developed countries of the Third World. Today they are highest in the least developed countries of Af-rica: 18 countries on that continent have rates of 125 or more, and in at least 4 countries (Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, and Sierra Leone) the infant mortal-ity rate continues to exceed 150 per 1,000 live births (Population Reference Bureau 1989).

Results from epidemiological studies and growing knowledge of the roles of epigenetics, stem cells, and the developmental origins of health and disease lend strong support to the ideas proposed by Vahlquist and the Jelliffes.

Never before in the history of science has so much been known about the complex importance of breastfeeding for both mothers and children.

p479  A strong protective eff ect was evident, with exclusively breastfed infants having only 12% of the risk of death compared with those who were not breastfed.10 <Sankar et al> Another three studies in LMICs showed that infants younger than 6 months who were not breastfed had 3·5-times (boys) and 4·1-times (girls) increases in mortality compared with those who received any breastmilk, and that that protection decreased with age.33 <Victora 2000 Lancet>

Not-breastfed 14x the IM risk of exclusively breastfed (ages 0-5 months)
All-cause mortality    
Table 2 depicts the pooled effects of respective breastfeeding practices on all-cause mortality ...  When compared to exclusively breastfed infants, predominantly breastfed infants aged 0–5 months had 48% more risk of mortality (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14–1.92, three studies); the risk of mortality was almost threefold higher in partially breastfed infants (RR 2.84, 95% CI 1.63–4.97, three studies) and 14-fold higher in infants who were not breastfed (RR 14.4, 95% CI 6.13–33.9; two studies) (Fig 2). When the two breastfeeding categories – exclusive and predominant – were combined and then compared with other categories, infants who were partially breastfed and not breastfed were found to have 2.3- and 2.5-fold higher risk of mortality, respectively (Table 2). Compared to breastfed infants and children 6–23 months of age, those who were not breastfed had about 1.8- and 2.0-fold increase in the risk of mortality in 6–11 months and 12–23 months of age, respectively (Table 2)

Knodel & Kintner (1977)
There are ample studies indicating that, until rather recently, breast fed infants experienced lower mortality risks than artifically fed infants in the currently developed countries, and there is scattered evidence that this still holds true in the contemporary developing world (for a general review of such studies, see Wray, 1977)

Knodel & VanDeWalle 1967  -- more concerned with fertility-imr link?
In addition to the information supporting the connection between breast feeding and fertility,  considerable evidence has been gathered during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  linking breast feeding inversely to infant mortality. During this time great concern was shown in  several areas of Europe

p200  ...  But Graunt is not specifically concerned about infant mortality.   ...  It is important to recall these first calculations: indeed, though they did not focus on the difference between male and female infant mortality, they gave relevant indications on the difference in life expectancies. [re: Petty, Leibniz, Halley, Maitland, Arbuthnot]   ... Almost simultaneously around 1740, two Dutch authors2 constructed the first mortality or rather, survival tables, separately for each sex.3 [Kersseboom 1742 women live longer]

p203 Muret and Moheau, among others, highlighted the high male mortality before the age of one (for example Moheau, [1778] 1994, I, XI, Question V, p. 166). By the end of the first year, the surplus of males had disappeared. Wargentin's observations confirmed this clearly: at birth itself 1292 girls survived for 1000 boys, 1,099 at the age of 1, 1022 at 2 and 3, 1,043 at 4 and 5, 1,074 between 5 and 10, and 1,080 between 10 and 15 (Wargentin, 1766, Tab. p. 18). Struyck observed that the higher male mortality began at a very early stage, because it also affected the foetus. In taking the average of children born at Breslau, Dresden and Leipzig, he noted that the ratio of stillborn boys to stillborn girls was 13 to 9 (Struyck, 1740, pp. 186–187).

Drevenstedt et al [2008 Proc NAS](https://www.pnas.org/content/105/13/5016.short) on excess male infant mortality, claiming it was only 10% in 1751, rising to >30% by 1970ish, then falling. Seems a mess for missing importance of level of IMR for relevance of sex-differential in IMR To us, exagerates importance of the early Sweden "data"

    Our analysis of 15 developed countries shows that, as infant mortality declined over two centuries, the excess male mortality increased from 10% in 1751 to >30% by approximately 1970. Remarkably, since 1970, the male disadvantage in most countries fell back to lower levels. The worsening male disadvantage from 1751 until 1970 may be due to differential changes in cause-specific infant mortality by sex.

p1063-64 West tables childhood mortality rates overstate female mort b/c historical data reflects excess female mortality from discrimination. After considering excess female mortality in ages 1-9, 
  
    p1064 A second and much larger question relates to the size of the male-female mortality differential in infancy. There is little doubt that in infancy boys have a clear survival disadvantage vis-d-vis girls (Preston, 1976; Lancaster, 1990; Waldron, 1987). The crucial issue is how large this disadvantage is and how it changes as mortality rates fall and life expectancy rises. "Coale’s “West” Table assume that the survival disadvantage of boys is comparatively modest.”10 (n10: at LE=40 West Table male "the absolute disadvantage in the male probability to die in infancy is 29.7/1000. In the Model Life Tables “East” used below the disadvantage is much larger, namely 36.5/1000.)  But, once again, this assumption is likely to be a peculiarity of the countries that make up the “West” Tables and could be a result of preferential treatment for male infants rather than the “natural” state of affairs.     ...  The higher fragility of male infants is likely to lead to a particularly large biological disadvantage in a high mortality environment so that in those populations the sex ratio of mortality in infancy should be higher (Waldron 1983, 1985, 1987).

[p112-13 The reasons for this low masculinity are not understood.]      In the developing world recently, and perhaps more importantly in the past, the females carried out much of the work in the fields and had their general well-being disturbed by high fertility rates.

ABSTRACT However, stratification of a sample  by socioeconomic indicators shows that white infant male and female  postneonatal mortality rates converge as the mothers' or parents'  education rises and as the mothers age.
p285 ...  Present findings can be seen as congruent with a theory of sex-biased parental investment.
p286  ... boys fare relatively best among the most advantaged families. Where girls have a mortality advantage in general, as in the United States, improved survival for boys means that the disparity between the sexes virtually disappears when the top echelon of society is reached ...
p288  A plausible challenge to the sociobiological interpretation of the present findings is that the convergence of infant boys' and girls' mortality in the high social status sector occurs because of the female physiological advantage and because child rearing at this pinnacle is so good. That is, the marginal gains still possible for girls are nearly zero, whereas boys, who are more vulnerable (Abramowicz and Barnett 1970; Khoury et al.  1985; Naeye et al. 1971; Yip et al. 1985; McMillen 1979), can still derive  significant incremental benefit from the best care

Guillot M, Gerland P, Pelletier F, Saabneh A (2012) Child Mortality Estimation: A Global Overview of Infant and Child Mortality Age Patterns in Light of New Empirical Data. [PLoS Med 9(8): e1001299.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.10)   Interesting for variation in 1q0 relative to 4q1 with implications for IMR vs u5MR

 Even though 5q0 is not free of errors (e.g., it is affected by omission of under-five deaths), it is generally considered a more reliable indicator than 1q0 and 4q1 in sample surveys, because unlike 1q0and 4q1, it is not subject to incorrect reporting of whether a death occurred before or after the child’s first birthday. Another reason is that the larger amount of mortality exposure embodied in 5q0 attenuates the amount of random sampling error for that indicator.

Model life tables for both sexes combined are obtained from sex-specific model life tables by calculating a weighted average of male and female values of 4q1 predicted at a given level of 1q0 while assuming a sex ratio at birth of 1.05.    
In this paper, we focus on the relationship between 4q1 and 1q0, instead of the relationship between 5q0 and 1q0. The relationship between 5q0 and 1q0 is a byproduct of the relationship between the 4q1 and 1q0. Indeed, the three indicators are related with one another through the equation 5q0 = 1−(1−1q0)(1−4q1). We decided to focus on the relationship between 4q1 and 1q0, because these two indicators have no age overlap, which generates more variance and makes patterns of deviation easier to detect.

[Under age 5 mortality](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/ea4f3775-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/ea4f3775-en)<br>
The under age 5 mortality rate is an indicator of child health as well as the overall development and well-being of a population. As part of their Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations has set a target of reducing under age 5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1 000 live births by 2030 (United Nations, 2015[8]).

   ...  In addition, focused efforts need to be undertaken to improve neonatal survival as more than three-quarters of under age 5 deaths occur in the neonatal period.

Under age 5 mortality is defined as the probability of a child born in a given year dying before reaching their fifth birthday, and is expressed per 1 000 live births. Since under age 5 mortality is derived from a life table, it is, strictly speaking, not a rate but a probability of death.

    “addressing infant mortality as a single measure […] ? not only-disguises a fundamental fissure between neonatal and post-neonatal mortality” (Reid, 2001, 213), but also fails to take the complexity of the determinants of infant survival into account. Infant mortality is no simple matter. An infant death can be caused by a wide array of factors of very different nature. The process eventually leading to death is usually neither plain nor straightforward and is influenced by a large number of determinants that can favour its course or oppose it and even avoid its worst consequences. […] Referring to infant mortality as a whole can be necessary and even useful when we aim at providing aggregate measures, establishing comparisons or outlining trends for large populations, but we must keep in mind that it is a statistical artefact we are dealing with […]when it comes to moving from description to interpretation, a more analytical approach is required, taking into account the heterogeneity embedded in infant mortality.

 279  ... The Hague evolved from a  provincial capital and quiet residential area into a  big modern city. In 1850, the city had about 72,000  inhabitants. After 1870, when prosperity increased,  the population grew steadily, reaching 206,000 at the turn of the century. More than half of this  growth was due to migration.   ... The Hague is located in an area of the Netherlands  where the highest infant mortality rates were to be  found until the 1880s. Before the onset of mortality  decline in the 1870s, infant mortality rates usually  fluctuated between 200 and 250 per thousand  births, while early-childhood mortality rates 4m1)  fluctuated between 40 and 50 per thousand person-years. Just before the decline in the first half of  the 1870s, infant and early-childhood mortality  peaked. The high infant mortality rates are thought  to have been due to the fact that much of the sur-face and ground water in the western provinces of  the Netherlands was heavily contaminated. Canals were used for the disposal of waste, while water  from the canals was used for household purposes by  the poor. A system of casks for the collection of  human excrements was established in The Hague in 1871 and a system of water pipes in 1874 (Van Son 1986 ...) . By 1910 the infant mortality rate had declined to  less than 100, while early-childhood mortality had  declined to about 10.

1993 Corsini & Viazzo 4 case studies: Sweden, England, France, Austria 

p9, the start of their text: 

    The basic facts about the secular decline of infant mortality in Europe have been known for nearly a century. Vital registration series are available for most European countries from the 1870s, and for virtually all of Europe from 1900. They show that the levels of infant mortality in the late nineteenth century were still extremely high and could vary quite markedly from one country to another, ranging from about 100 per 1.000 live births in Norway and Sweden to 200 or even 250 per 1.000 in countries such as Germany, Austria and Russia. At the turn of the century. however. infant mortality began to fall almost right across the continent. As the decline was steeper in the countries with higher mortality levels, a certain degree of convergence to lower levels can already be detected in the first decades of the twentieth century. By the 1950s, when national rates of infant mortality ranged between 90 and 50 per 1000, the process of convergence was nearly completed. The fall in infant mortality, which was paralleled by a simultaneous and equally pronounced decline of fertility, was responsible for raising life expectancy in many European countries by more than 10 years over a remarkably short period of time. <br><br>While the basic facts are quite clear, the reasons accounting for the decline are anything but certain. Improvements in infant and child survival have long been assumed to be broadly associated with advances in health care and rising living standards. But until fairly recently. surprisingly few attempts have been made to unravel the diverse influences of the social, economic and public health factors which have supposedly played a part in lowering infant mortality in Europe.
    
</p><p>Discussion of McKeown follows (as usual, confusing, since IMR improvements came so long after econ growth started)
</p><p>p12 
   
     It is unanimously agreed that both national and regional variations in the level of infant mortality can largely be accounted for by differences in infant feeding patterns. Indeed. if we consider the four national Cases presented in this volume, we see that breast—feeding, whose beneficial effects on infant mortality are well known n5 was widespread (though not universal) in Sweden. France and England, whereas it was only rarely practised in Austria. However, much work remains to be done in order to reach a Clear under-standing of the relationship between infant feeding and infant mortality, Social and demo-graphic historians will first have to determine the reasons why mothers in some parts of Europe undertook prolonged periods of breastfeeding while those in other regions did not. It will also be necessary to verify whether fluctuations in the levels of infant mortality correlate with changes in the duration and intensity of lactation or any other alterations in feed-ing practices. While accepting that feeding patterns strongly influenced mortality levels and that they are able to explain regional and local continuities. many scholars suspect that feeding practices are unlikely to have changed sufficiently quickly or radically to have caused the often abrupt start of the secular decline of infant mortality. In any case. feeding habits were not the only factor behind spatial variations in infant mortality.

     ... In fact, regional variations can in many cases be explained simply by the different weight of the urban component in the population, for it is well known that in historic Europe infant mortality was higher in towns and cities than in the surrounding rural areas. This was primarily due to the inferior urban public health environment and to overcrowding. which facilitated the spread of airborne and contagious diseases much more than in the sparsely populated countryside.

Interesting to speculate on: maybe rural to urban shift tends to compromise breast-feeding?

 Perrenoud has formalized this difference between the Norwegian and Swedish pattern and that of the rest of Europe, by distinguishing a 'northern' and 'western' model for the nineteenth century: the northern model 'with constant and more or less regular decline',  and the western model 'which shows no tendency to decline before the 1880s, and even  a prominent increase between 1830-1840 and 1860 1870'.12

463 Norway stands out with the lowest levels throughout the period. Norwegian infant mortality was according to an estimate, close to 200 per 1,000 live births during the second part of the eighteenth century, dropping to a level of around 150 at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Towards 1850 infant mortality in Norway had dropped to a level of 100. During the second half of the eighteenth century, infant mortality in Sweden and in Finland was slightly higher than in Norway. Whereas levels of infant mortality remained at the high level of around 200 in <464> Finland until 1870, Sweden in line with Norway experienced a drop in mortality at the beginning of the nineteenth century.11 Towards the midnineteenth century, infant mortality in Sweden was around 150, a level close to Denmark’s.   ... Iceland presents more extreme levels of infant mortality, only infrequently dropping below 250 during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, levels mainly explained by the prevailing tradition of feeding the newborn artificially ....

Perhaps obviously, the time-pattern of infant deaths affects the SR1, as early deaths pull down the SR (because the excess male births play a smaller role in the cumulative SR1). To illustrate the magnitude of the effect: 23% IMR early-death pattern sees SR drop of 3.4 while even-death pattern has SR drop 2.4; 11% IMR early-death SR drop of 1.6 and even-death SR drop of 1.1. DETAILS: with 104 225(250/200); with my idea of realistic (.5,.15,.14,.1,.1)  104 goes to 100.6; with even 104 to 101.7   OR IMR 113(125/100) 104 to 102.4 vs 104 to 102.9   So the bigger effects occur at higher IMR and higher male excess IMR ...

2003 Sen shift in source of missing women, from mortality to selective abortion. Interesting for us is the use of SR05 as indicator of missing women. Also India division: N&W missing girls, S&E not.  

Klasen & Wink (2003 Feminist Econ) about same info as 2002? Maybe tone differs: harsher on China; more generally, notion excess fem mort stabilized at a high level    

Klasen & Wink (2002 PopDevR).  As in Klasen (1994 World Dev): Coale's (1991) constant SBR overstates expected sex ratios in poor countries (and therefore understates missing women). Some improvement since 1990s. "After significant improvements in Bangladesh and Pakistan, India now has the highest share of missing females among countries for which we have reliable demographic data."  increasing use of sex-selective induced abortion

Klasen (1994 World Dev)  For SBR rising with income/SES and for West Life Table understates male IMR disadvantage   p1064 "Coale’s “West” Table assume that the survival disadvantage of boys is comparatively modest.”10 (n10: at LE=40 West Table male "the absolute disadvantage in the male probability to die in infancy is 29.7/1000. In the Model Life Tables “East” used below the disadvantage is much larger, namely 36.5/1000.)  But, once again, this assumption is likely to be a peculiarity of the countries that make up the “West” Tables and could be a result of preferential treatment for male infants rather than the “natural” state of affairs. The higher fragaility of male infants is likely to lead to a particularly large biological disadvantage in a high mortality environment so that in those populations the sex ratio of mortality in infancy should be higher (Waldron 1983, 1985, 1987)." Waldron sex-differences in mortality. Probably Waldron 1993 for Euro men higher mortality via drink/drive/violence

This paper quantifies the relationship between desired fertility and the sex ratio in India by eliciting sex composition preferences at specified fertility levels. I find that the desired sex ratio increases sharply as fertility falls and that fertility decline explains one third to one half of India’s recent sex ratio increase.     
This paper’s contribution is to directly estimate the causal relationship between family size and the desired sex ratio and to quantify an important cause of rising sex ratios.    
p128 To summarize, as family size grows, the desired percent sons falls sharply. To first approximation, families want one son, and if that preference is satisfied, they want close to an equal number of sons and daughters. These patterns point to the desire for an eldest son as the central feature of son preference     
p131 The projected sex ratio matches the trend more closely for the second half of the period, which is consistent with the diffusion of ultrasound being the main driver of the rising sex ratio in the 1980s and early 1990s, and then fertility decline playing a major role in the last decade, once access to ultrasound was widespread.

The paper is utter garbage. They use subsaharan Africa's relatively high death rates of women of child-bearing age to argue for missing women. And US 1900 women are dying in childbirth, creating the appearance of "missing women" there.  GARBAGE  twisting of the fact that economic development has hugely reduced maternal death (and that male behavior-based deaths in rich nations is most of male deaths until old-age) ... Consider their calculation of subsaharan missing women age 20-24: their counterfactual (CF) female mortality is via the female/male rate of developed world. Devoloped has death rate (ages 20-24, throughout what follows) for males 2.94 times the female (1.1/0.4); subsahAfr male mortality is 5.7, so CF female mort is 5.7/2.94 or under 2 ... actual female mort is 9.4, so the female mortality among subsaharan women is be 9.4/(5.7/2.94) or  4.85 times actual mort.  And they use UN/WHO death rates for U1 and 1-4 to argue for missing girls in subsaharan Africa. But I bet if we looked at sex-ratios by age we would NOT see evidence of missing girls ... I bet the death rates approach and a sex-ratio approach will give opposite reulsts for subsah africa ...

ABSTR:  ... ; (2) as a proportion of the total female population, the number of missing women is largest in sub-Saharan Africa, and the absolute numbers are comparable to those for India and China; ... Finally, using historical data, we argue that a comparable proportion of women was missing at the start of the 20th century in the United States, just as they are in India, China, and sub-Saharan Africa today.   
1263  For each category—age, and later, age and disease—we posit a “reference” death rate for females, one that would be obtained if the death rate of males in that country were to be rescaled by the relative death rates for males and females (in the same category) in developed countries.6 We subtract this reference rate from the actual death rate for females, and then multiply by the population of females in that category. This is the definition of “missing women” in the category of interest   ...  In sub-Saharan Africa, the sex ratio at birth is [p1264] approximately 1.03, much lower than for developed countries as a whole (which is 1.06). There appear to be genetic differences that determine this ratio.7   n7 Indeed, the sex ratio at birth for whites in the United States is around 1.06 whereas for blacks it is 1.03. The available data for births from sub-Saharan parents in the United States suggests similar numbers as well.

### Language choices (rhetoric/clarity) -- MORTAL NEGLECT & FRAIL MALE
In the context of using sex ratio differences to test for sex discrimination, we use the phrase **mortal neglect** to refer to deliberate and malicious? witholding or withdrawal of the minimal care and attention required to keep an infant or child alive (or prevent them from dying?). This is about the usage of Lynch (), and is quite different from the meaning of the phrase as used earlier by Scheper-Jones (referring to neglect of "doomed infants" -- in which case neglect hastens an imminent death). 
In the context of identifying the biological/physiological bases for male-biased infant and child mortality, we use the phrase "frail male" to refer to the male's greater susceptibility to disease and lesser resilence to malnutrion CONGENITAL STUFF too? IS THIS? This is somewhat narrower than the usage of PSYCH-GUY (DATE) who addresses the broader range of pyshc and emotional needs of boys and men, in the context of arguing for more nuturing? Challenging current stereotypes of masculinity and binaries of gender?   
OLDER COMMENTS^[Choosing our terms: mortal neglect, selective neglect, of girls? If the former, we need to footnote and clarify that we aren't using it in the sense of Scheper-Hughes). Jim's current (200618) sense is we use the term mortal neglect, and **not** in quotation marks. Instead we define mortal neglect as a *lack* of care and attention that substantially increase probability of death (like by 10%-points or more -- issue is additive, not multiplicative). Scheper-Hughes refers to *withdrawal* of care, suggesting initial care that is rescinded).]

infant deaths per 1,000 live births compared with the 5.79 reported officially."  
FRED 2004 values:  Cuba 5.8  Costa Rica 9.2 Chile 7.9    World Bank
We look at SR1 and find ... UN Data is odd, 2004 Cuba SR1 1.08? 

2012  Ward & Devereaux   1953 Cuba middle income ...

also some crappy stuff drawing on G&G's Demography, in *Health Policy and Planning* -- questioning validity of data and arguing for forced abotion Berdine, Gelso, Powell; Hirschfield; seems like politically motivated shit


#### Spain

For lit review only (Tapia & Gallego-Martinez allude to declining SR1 and worsening conditions)
Tapia & Gallego‐Martínez (2017 EEH, 2020 EHR) Use sex-ratios to look gender discrimination; uses European SR04 for comparisons 
2017 p120n22 The decline in the sex ratio during the last third of the 19th century might be related to the worsening of living conditions during the first stages of modern economic growth (Martínez-Carrión and Pérez-Castejón, 2002, 421). 

2020EHR What explains the missing girls in nineteenth-century Spain?   2020EHR repeats 2017 discussion of SR1 and SR04 and Spain's suspiciously high sex ratios. 
2017 p Therefore, instead of around 105.9, infant sex ratios in the absence of gender discrimination should have been expected to be somewhat just below parity (99.4) in mid-19th century Spain.19 
p66  Due to the female biological survival advantage in utero and during infancy, sex ratios should theoretically be lower under severe economic conditions.40 If, on the contrary, economic deprivation shows a positive relationship with the prevalence of boys, it would be evidence of potential gender discrimination, in the form of either female infanticide or the neglect of young girls, especially in terms of nutritional deprivation and susceptibility to infection. It may be the case that both effects offset each other, so the lack of a clear relationship between these variables and the sex ratio might be (cautiously) interpreted as weak evidence of gender bias <br>  n40 OUCH -- cites own EEH -- maybe earlier discussion justifies the cavalier (light) validation/evidence <br>p74 Rather than being the result of female infanticide or the mistreatment of young girls, the excess female mortality discussed here was probably due to an unequal allocation of resources within the household


2017EEH Where are the missing girls? Gender discrimination in 19th-century Spain  
5 The demographic transition in Spain did not start until the late 19th century and the early 20th century (Dopico and Reher, 1998). Anthropometric evidence confirms the deplorable living conditions existent in mid-19th-century Spain. See, for instance, Martínez-Carrión and Pérez-Castejón (2000), Martínez-Carrión (2002) or Moreno-Lázaro (2006)

infant mortality debate -- was 1970s rise of soviet IMR a figment of improved reporting in southern republics (Muslim)? Maybe we can use behavior of SR1 (but a Kyrgistan paper argues for son-preference and selective abortion there, more recently)


Issue for J&J: 1940ish level of health?  short kids, I gather ...  1940 IMR 200 (maybe 250, if add 1/4 for definition correction)

Jones & Grupp p214pdf3 section title  "Soviet infant mortality in  historical perspective"   1909 IMR 297 in European Russia (note 11:(Statistical Reference Book of the USSR for 1928 (Moscow)); "infant death rates in Moscow and St. Petersb were double those of Paris and London" (n12) p215 By 1925 European RSFSR 229   1926 193  1927 217  1917 Ukraine 148 Belorussia 99      "Reported infant mortality for the USSR as a whole was 182 in 1940, up  from 174 in 1926. n19   The higher 1940 figure was probably due to better reporting  of infant deaths in the European areas and the inclusion of data from high- [p216] mortality southern tier areas that had previously been excluded "   Turkmenistan probably higher than the reported 250 in 1939 (n20)       After WWII IM declines in European areas of USSR  Leningrad  1940 196  1945 148 1950 82     p217 RSFSR rate 37 "higher than the reported rates for four of the five Muslim republics for which we have data."(p218)  " The lower reported rates in the southern tier areas were due to faulty  reporting, not better health conditions"  p227 southern tier areas  "Increasingly  complete reporting in these regions produced erratic increases in reported infant  death rates in the 1960s, followed by a dramatic upsurge in reported infant  mortality in the early 1970s."   Some small increase in IMR in Euro-Russia, p233 maybe connected to reduced stillbirths via resusitation  of asphixia victims    Velkoff & Miller largely disagree, claiming it's post neo-natal rural deaths that increase (seems like a non sequitur to me)
