    p45 Some biological studies emphasised a decrease in male-female height  differences under conditions of nutritional stress (Wolanski and Kasprzak 1976; Gray and Wolfe 1980; Brauer 1982; Lieberman 1982; Stini 1985). According to these studies, dimorphism increases with improvement in nutritional status. Based on these findings and their biological theorising, they hypothesised that women are more ‘resilient’ during crisis periods.fferences under conditions of nutritional stress (Wolanski and Kasprzak 1976; Gray and Wolfe 1980; Brauer 1982; Lieberman 1982; Stini 1985). 
p46  Though Tanner argues for the existence of female robustness in the situations of radiation and undernutrition, there is a dearth of information about sample size and physiological mechanisms.

p51  Johnson and Nicholas (1995) argued that both males and females born between the early 1820s and the mid-1850s in the UK suffered from nutritional stress. 

p53 Also, heights in Kazakhstan – one of the former Soviet republics in Central Asia – have been stagnating or declining, with the height of girls developing even worse than boys’ height due to religiously induced discrimination in the labour market (Dangour et al. 2003).

Harris (2009 Ch 4 of *Gender and Well-being in Europe*)
   According to James Tanner (1962: 127), ‘girls … are less easily thrown off their growth curves … than boys’ and McCance argued that ‘males are more vulnerable [to undernutrition] … and rehabilitate less completely’ (see Thomson et al. 1967).  British Journal of Preventive & Social Medicine

   p65 These findings appeared to reinforce Tanner’s view that girls were more resistant to adverse conditions and that there was more scope for the heights of boys to increase as conditions improved (Harris 1998: 425–8)


ThomsonA et al 1967  

     p139 It is generally agreed that adult stature responds less dramatically to environmental improvement than does the stature of children. Most of the evidence of secular increase in adult stature has been derived from men, and there may be a sex difference.      {PARAG} McCance (1966) notes that "Males are more vulnerable [to undernutrition in early life] than females in some and possibly all species and rehabilitate less completely." Acheson and Fowler (1964) considered that "Boys are more readily influenced by environmental factors than are girls, both as to their rate of skeletal maturation and to their linear growth." Bakwin and McLaughlin (1964) found that male Harvard entrants from public schools (Americanstyle) had increased in average height, but not those from private schools; but female entrants to Wellesley showed no change in either group. It may be noted that, by contrast with these highly selected American groups, the Aberdeen mothers cannot in general be considered as having grown up in an optimum or near-optimum environment.

2020 Davenport (2020 EHR) on Mortality & Urbanization in England 1830-50?  COMPARISONS TO URBAN FRANCE     
ABSTRACT: this study finds good evidence for widespread increases in mortality in the second quarter of the nineteenth century.   
 
Haines commented that ‘one must conclude that large American cities had become virtual charnel houses by the middle of the xixth century’.56 "Urban Mortality" 2001

p458 mid-18th C Eng IMR 180    London 300-400    ...    the most notorious Victorian cities, Liverpool and Manchester,     
p459 death rates in English cities in the mid-nineteenth century were modest by the standards of many continental European cities. This was particularly the case with respect to infant mortality, but mortality at older ages was also unexceptional. London, then the largest city in Europe, was extraordinarily salubrious compared with much smaller British and continental cities.17 However, even the unhealthiest British cities, including Liverpool, Manchester, and Glasgow, were unremarkable by continental standards.18     
p481 the worsening of urban mortality rates in the middle decades of the nineteenth century was not confined to British industrial towns and cities. Rather it appears to have been a very widespread phenomenon that affected rural as well as urban populations.       ....     However, scarlet fever should be considered a major explanatory factor.   
Our evidence indicates that there were indeed very widespread rises especially in early childhood mortality in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, that were sustained until roughly 1870.
p482 ... (re height declines)  Our results therefore lend tentative support to arguments that childhood health and development were depressed in the mid-nineteenth century. However, it remains very unclear whether the observed hikes in childhood mortality, especially from scarlet fever, were associated with increases in chronic ill health, or represented acute events with few sequelae for survivors

2019 Allen (EHR 2019; submit 2016.07; 2018.02 online) "Class Structure ... Social Tables ..."   provides benchmarks at 1867 1846 1798 1759 1688  ...

    1688 forward (>3x subsistence); some improvement in 2nd 1/2 18th C; big gains 1846-67
 "during the first half of the 19th C, ... The average real income of workers ... stagnated.  ... between 1846 and 1867 ...  working class consumption grew by 42%  ....  The average real income of workers, on the other hand, stagnated

    The standard of living of the working class has been a particularly contentious issue in the historiography of the industrial revolution. The classic debate centred on the first half of the nineteenth century and concerned the impact of industrialization. More recently, attention has turned to the eighteenth century: was Britain a high wage economy in the run‐up to the industrial revolution?60  ...  King, Massie, and Colquhoun ... these social observers ... In their eyes, England was definitely a high wage economy. English workers were always very well off by international standards: The average member of a working‐class family in England always got more than three subsistence baskets each year (table 5), while many Europeans, Latin Americans, and Asians were lucky to get one.61  ...  English workers did not consume three times the oatmeal specified in the subsistence diet but instead upgraded their consumption to bacon, beer, and white bread. For this reason, English men were also taller than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.62 (cite Floud, Fogel, Harris, Hong &  Restatement,)

In the 1830s and 1840s, families in mining and factory districts earned higher incomes than their rural counterparts,   higher male wages and higher children's earnings.

Experiences among this sector were also much more diverse, with a few families living on a per capita income that was on a par with the agricultural workers, a few earning four or five times as much, and the rest scattered widely between these two extremes.

p110  Rural society was largely unchanging and remarkably equal, but only because the great majority of workers had so miserably little in the first place. The incomes of industrial families were, on average, higher, but they were also much more divergent       As male incomes rose, their breadwinning became more unreliable, which created new forms of inequality within families as well as between them    
The evidence is clear: industrialization ushered in a far more complex, and unequal, society than that which it replaced. It is time to abandon the optimist/pessimist framework and to develop suitably plural, historical approaches and perspectives.  
p111  Industrialization did not just raise wages, lengthen working hours, depress heights, and so on. It wrought fundamental changes in patterns of family life, human existence, and social relations. So long as male wages had provided for no more than the meanest subsistence, all members of the family were tightly bound in a nexus of needs and responsibilities; but when men were able to earn something better than a subsistence wage they — and they alone — were freed from that nexus.    changes within the family dynamic   significant for      hard economic questions.   
cultural change lay at the heart of Britain’s industrial transition, and contains the key to understanding the social distribution of the nation’s newfound wealth.

2015 Allen Restatement    -- responds to Humphries      late 18C Brits are tallest Europeans; via Cinnerella (heights) "the standard of living slipped during the second quarter of the 19th C, for the heights of the men born in that period dropped. Why this happened is not entirely clear. There are three possibil-ities.43 (Komlos: shrinking)"  decreased W via increased inequality; pollution and disease of large cities; decr rel price of manuf goods so perhaps shift away from kids food. Allen says none matter for the high-wage explanation of the Ind Rev  

      p13. The economic implications of declining heights came in the later Victorian period. The British workforce of the 1880s and 1890s was shorter than the workforce of the 1780s and 1790s. Perhaps intellectual development was also adversely affected. The decline in the quality of the work- force may have contributed to Britain’s poor productivity performance in the late nineteenth century.          ...  At the end of the eighteenth century, the geographical distribution of these attributes was not dissimilar to that  of height.45 The highest levels of literacy and numeracy were reached in Britain, the US, and the Low Countries. They were followed by north-eastern France, western Germany, and Scandinavia.                         ....   Wages, height, and literacy point to an important conclusion: the quality of childhood in eighteenth-century Britain was high in comparison to that in most other parts of the world.
 V   Underlying all of her criticisms of the high wage economy is Humphries’s view that living standards for many people were low during the industrial revolution
   p18   "The ‘standard of living question’ was the result of the liquidation of the traditional sectors that were responsible for the prosperity of the eighteenth century. The standard of living problem was big because these sectors were large.55"    16th 17th C L family could not afford "respectable" standard of living   "The situation changed between 1700 and 1775 due to the rise in spinners’ wages. In this ‘golden age’ the family earned 20 per cent more than necessary to purchase the respectability standard."   p19  but figure 6 shows how the general prosperity of the high wage economy of the eighteenth century gave way to enormous inequality as the industrial revolution unfolded. " FIG 6 shows Agric L incomes mostly the same 1770-1860 (but variable, some jumps, 1845-55?) INCREASED INEQUALITY   VI  English working class ate bread, cheese, meat (as described by Engels?) BEER?

"Lure ... Patriarchal Perspective ... " -- promising for us, for pregnant woman's caloric needs (but what of the "just buy oatmeal" alternative? )     
p695  The main criticism presented in this article  ...  begins with the claim that wages at the end of the eighteenth century were historically high and provided a living standard ‘far above bare bones subsistence’
   706  Moreover, there is good evidence to suggest that infant and  childhood mortality deteriorated in the first half of the nineteenth century, meaning that families faced the costs of bearing and at least partially raising children only to have them die before adulthood with greater frequency.55

Cinnirella 2008 
  We revise previous estimates on average nutritional status in Britain during the industrial revolution. We find that average nutritional status declined substantially throughout the period 1740–1865, with a partial recovery only for the cohorts born in 1805–9 and 1810–14. The decline in nutritional status estimated for the second half of the eighteenth century is consistent with recent estimates of food prices and farm labour wages. We suggest that parliamentary enclosures and the decline of cottage industry could partially explain the fall in nutritional status. In addition, comparing the age at final attainment of height of a group of rural residents with a group of urban migrants we provide further evidence about the negative impact of urbanization during the early industrial revolution.

p1318     Feinstein calculates that English workers gained 47 percent in real wages from the 1770s to the 1860s. The evidence here suggests that the gains for building workers were a much more substantial 82 percent. As before with Phelps Brown and Hopkins, the reason for my much greater optimism is almost entirely that my estimated cost of living rises much less than Feinstein’s. It was not till the 1820s that real wages advanced beyond their level in the middle of the eighteenth century   p1319 Only in the 1820s did real wages begin showing robust growth. Between then and the 1860s, real-wage growth averaged 0.9 percent per year     p1320  But, nevertheless, Irish real wages rose because of the declining prices of cloth, candles, fuel, sugar, and tea

2004 Steckel "Based on a modest sample of skeletons from northern Europe, average heights fell from 173.4 centimeters in the early Middle Ages to a low of roughly 167 centimeters during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Taking the data at face value, this decline of approximately 6.4 centimeters substantially exceeds any prolonged downturns found during industrialization in several countries that have been studied. Significantly, recovery to levels achieved in the early Middle Ages was not attained until the early twentieth century.   ...   it is plausible to link the reversal of the long-term height decline with dietary improvements."

p343 the evidence suggests that poor pregnant women suffered from growing malnutri-tion because industrialization and rapid population growth progressively deepened their poverty.
p345 Thus far, the debate over standards of living has yielded enough evidence to indicate that malnutrition and development went hand in hand. If so, the case of the pessimists will have been dramatically affirmed.

p46 The debate about the standard of living under early industrialism has now continued for some thirty years.Among academic historians, in  Britain at any rate, the pendulum has swung away from the classical  view, held by enquirers and historians of all political views2 until the appear-ance of Clapham's *Economic History of Modern Britain*.  It is today heterodox to  believe that early industrialization was a catastrophe for the labouring poor of  this or other countries, let alone that their standard of living declined.
p60    It is altogether likely that living-standards improved over much of the 18th C. It is not improbable that soon after the onset of the Ind Rev ... [p61] they ceased to improved and declined. Perhaps the middle 1790s ... mark a turning-point. At the other end, the middle 1840's certainly mark a turning-point 
   sum up as follows. The classical view has been put in Sidney Webb's words: 2 'If the Chartists in 1837 had called for a comparison of their time with 1787, and had obtained a fair account of the actual social life of the working-man at the two periods, it is almost certain that they would have recorded a positive decline in the standard of life of large classes of the population.'

Webb (1897)    
p2 If the Chartists, in 1837, had called for a comparison of their time with 1787, and had obtained a fair account of the actual social life of the ordinary working man at the two periods, it is almost certain that they would have recorded a positive de-[p4]cline in the standard of life of large classes of the population. 
 "And ... a trustworthy comparison of [1787] with 1737  ... [would show] a smilar decline. There seems reason to believe, indeed, that in 1837 some large sections of the 'dim inarticulate multitude' were struggling in the trough of a century's decline in all that makes life worth living." 
p6   1837 marks almost the lowest depth of degradation of the English rural population, and a very low level indeed in the condition of the miner and the mill operative.
p7 In comparing ourselves with 1837 we set an appallingly low standard, 

p16 It will not, I think, be generally disputed that the last sixty years have seen a very great advance in the condition of a very large part of the people. But it is essential to notice the fact that this great advance in prosperity, this great rise in the standard of life, has not been universal. There are living in our midst to-day considerable masses of people who, as regards their economic circumstances, are still in 1837.    
p17   Mr. Charles Booth ...  some 32 per cent of the whole four millions of London's population fall within his four classes of “poverty,” earning not more than a guinea per week per family. It is difficult to believe that, even in 1837, the percentage of persons at a corresponding low [p18] level can have been greater.   ...   out of this huge residuum nearly a third are actually below what can be called even full subsistence for a London family, we shall begin to feel that our boasted progress since 1837 has not, after all, taken us very far.     
p21 Out of the four millions of women who are working for wages at the present time, a very large percentage must be earning practically no better subsistence than their grandmothers did.

### Wales
Can we link higher SR2 to rural-ness?  Maybe industrial areas of Wales are blighted in 1841? [BBC site on Wales](https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/guide/ch15_industrial_revolution.shtml) identify      It was north-east Wales which developed the greatest range of industries. By the late 18th century there were 19 metalworks at Holywell and 14 potteries at Buckley; Holywell and Mold had cotton mills; lead and coal mines proliferated. Bersham, where the Wilkinson family were pioneers in the use of coke rather than charcoal in the smelting of iron, was one of Europe's leading ironworks.      
In the long term, however, the developments in the south east were more important. The ironworks of Merthyr Tydfil [a borough of Glamorgan] - Cyfarthfa and Dowlais in particular - gave rise to Wales's first industrial town. By 1830 Monmouthshire and east Glamorgan were producing half the iron exported by Britain.

ABS The malign contribution of northern industrial cities to the stagnation of national life expectancy over the period 1820–1870 forms part of one of the most long-running debates in English economic history, regarding the impact of early industrialisation on living standards.   ...   We conclude (1) that any worsening of water quality in urban areas c.1800–1850 was not confined to new or rapidly growing industrial or manufacturing towns; and (2) infants probably rarely drank untreated water, so high infant or diarrhoeal mortality rates should not be read as indicators of poor water quality, in the English context.
  ATTACK SZRETER  
  life expectancy improved at the aggregate national level between 1750 and 1820, and survival rates of infants and young children rose dramatically in London and probablyin other urban centres over the same period (Davenport,2015; Landers,1993, Chapters4–5; Wrigley, Davies, Oeppen, & Schofield,1997, p. 272)    Using a mixture of scant empirical evidence and extrapolation, Szreter and Mooney(1998) argued influentially that life expectancy fell in the national population between1820 and 1840 as a consequence of worsening conditions especially in northern indus-trial and manufacturing cities (Figure 1). 
  BUT   The higher infant and child mortality rates evident in the second half of the nineteenth century in many northern towns was probably also a feature of the first half of the century, as Szreter and Mooney argued. However it seems unlikely that this excess mortality was due to inferior water quality

  parish was chosen as a case study  ONE PARISH -- too narrow (but support OPTIMs)
By the 1860s, however, infant mortality rates in London had decreased dramatically (Landers, 1990; Schellekens, 2001), although the estimated mortality rates and the magnitude of decline in mortality over this period vary according to the method of calculation (Woods, 2006). The relative mortality of male and female infants is poorly documented in London during this important period of demographic and economic transition.
   Male infants have an inherent biological susceptibility to mortality at all ages compared with females, but this is particularly pronounced in early life. This underlying pattern of mortality, however, may be significantly influenced by infant feeding, weaning and health care behaviours for male and female infants, practices that are often socially and culturally determined (Waldron, 1983, 1987).
p117 marked decline in endogenous infant mortality, reflecting conditions
already present at birth,   Contrastingly, the reduction in total infant mortality was particularly steep between the 1790s and 1830s, despite the fact that this was a period of economic decline in the parish of Christ Church Spitalfield     ...  A plausible interpretation for these
results is that exclusive breast-feeding until the age of 3 months was widely practised in the 1830s resulting in substantially lower infant mortality in the first 3 months of life than in earlier periods.

Figure 1 shows mort decline at end 19thC .  Complicated geographic decomposition, using maps ... p791 confirms the basic snapshot pattern: Urban areas had high rates and rural areas had lower ones.   there is much to support the well-established urban story. Urban areas did indeed have high rates, they generally started to decline in the 1870s or 1880s   Urban areas   improvements were around the same as the national aggregate.   over much of the countryside, infant mortality decline started well [p792] before the 1870s  ...    This means that to understand the functioning of  the national aggregate, we must understand at least  three stories: the urban story of high rates that start  to decline in the 1870s and 1880s, the rural-core story of much larger declines starting much earlier, and the  rural-periphery story of the areas that lagged behind the  others. Within these there will clearly be many variations ...

   Wrigley, in comparing the  Cambridge Group's parish register reconstitution results with Woods's  work and with the official civil register data for the period after the  1830s, has concurred that there was a 'striking change' in the nation's  mortality regime across the 1 830s.5

 The evidence presented here indicates that, notwithstanding probable rises in male real wage rates, during the second quarter of the nineteenth century there was a serious deterioration in the standard of  living of the growing proportion of the population recruited into the  urban industrial workforce; and furthermore that this trend of deterioration, although halted in the late 1850s and 1860s, was not significantly  reversed until as late as the 1870s and 1880s.

Pre-famine Ireland:  consensus that it was poor but healthy (taller than English -- but all might be pretty short?).   
*IMR* is an unsettled issue (JRI not aware of others). Mokyr suggest 224 per K, and others suggest IMR above other Europeans. But the SR1 is inconsistent with that sort of IMR, absent mortal female-gender bias. E.g. suppose 25% infant mortality, male IMR 120% of female (for probabilities of death 272 and 227 per K), and SRB of 1.05: the SR of exact 1-yr-olds is 100.6; SR1 would be greater, because the M/F ratio is decreasing over the 0-12 month. For example, in a population with constant 25% infant mortality over the interval, SR1 would be about 103; with 2/3 of deaths in the first 3 months, SR1 moves down toward 102). Maybe IMR of 150 generates exact Yr1 SR of 102.6 so SR1 values of 103.5 would be reasonable ...

2007 OGrada overview essay in book from 2003 conference (Eh.net)   
    
     Ireland was a poor country in 1845, income per head being about half that in the rest of the United Kingdom. The regional contrast between the northeast, which was undergoing rapid industrialization at this time, and the west and the south was marked. Moreover, while there were some signs of a rise in urban and middleclass living standards, the half-century or so before the famine was aperiod of increasing impoverishment for the landless poor (Mokyr and O Grada, 1988).   ...  The nutritional content of the potato and widespread access to heating fuel in the form of turf eased  eased somewhat the poverty of Ireland's three million ‘potato people’, who were healthier and lived longer than the poor in other parts of Europe at the time. One indication of this, based on evidence from military and prison archives, is that adult Irish males from the lower end of the socio-economic scale on the eve of the famine were at least as tall as, if not taller than, their English peers (O Grada, 1991; Mokyr and O Grada, 1996). However, their poverty meant that when the potato failed, there was no trading down to a cheaper alternative food (O Grada, 1994a: 80~97).   
p55 conclusion notes "Several issues require further investigation" ... pre-famine well-being not among those. 

2004 Deborah Oxley (2004 SSH)  p279 Ulster's height advantage 
the devlopment gradient .. Ulster was the most developed, followed by Leinster and then Munster, while Connaught wasthe poorest. Deaths by starvation -- both absolute and relative to population size -- were exactly the inverse of this gradient ... (OGrada & ORourke 1997; Kennnedy et al. 1999:36-41)  Arguably, mortality was driven not by the crisis of a sudden crop failure, but by an ongoing level of destitution and enduring hardship that weakened resistance (Ô Grâda 1995: 3).


1997 Nicholas & Steckel -- JEEH publishes their 1992 NBER paper (tall but poor -- but covering 1785-1815, which they connect to M&OG?)

1996 Mokyr & OGrada (1996 EEH) p160 Yet on this evidence, it would be difficult to reject the claim that the Irish poor born between the 1780s and the 1840s were at least as tall as the English. Table 6 shows that Scottish workers were taller than either Irish or English (confirming the findings of Floud et al., 1990, pp. 202–209).  p161 m. The data fail to reveal any sustained improvement in observed height from the end of the Napoleonic Wars (birth cohorts of about 1790–1800) to the end of the 1850s (birth cohort of about 1835–1840). p163 All research thus far has pointed to a significant gap between Ireland and England in favor of the Irish, a gap that declines from the mid-18th century to the Famine. Furthermore, the Scots were generally taller than either the Irish or the English. It is reassuring here to find convict, military, and admiralty records all pointing in the same direction. Other information, too, suggests that the pre-Famine Irish were relatively tall and well fed (e.g., O´ Gra´da, 1992). We have also been able to establish that the unhealthy effects of cities seem to translate into the somewhat lower height of urban recruits, t p164 These differences prompt a final methodological reflection. The sensitivity in outcomes to the welfare measure used is partly resolved by the distinction between living standards and nutritional status. It is sometimes assumed that they are positively correlated—but the evidence suggests that this correlation is a loose one.

1996 OGrada (1996 Histoire Mesure)    p148 results indicated that Irish poverty was mitigated by a nutritious diet. p160 All work so far has pointed to a gap between Ireland and England in favour of the Irish, a gap that declines from the mid-eighteenth century to the Famine. Again, Scots were generally taller than either the Irish and the English. Even here there is cause for caution. The Irish pre-famine advantage may stem partly - and paradoxically - from the relative poverty of Ireland, since this would have induced a relatively better quality Irish recruit. While the Irish height advantage is striking and probably genuine - it survives cross-tabulations by occupation and region - these limitations of inferences based on volunteer army data must be borne in mind. In the circumstances, it is reassuring (and important) to find convict, military, and admiralty records all pointing in the same direction. Other information, too, suggests that the **pre-Famine Irish were relatively tall and well-fed**     p161 omes. The dependence on the potato and other low-value but high-calorie foods in poorer countries, and often accidental relationship between desirable and wholesome diets create lots of problems for those who would infer living standards from nutritional status alone

In this scenario, as explained by Joel Mokyr, "population grew unrestrained, continuously exacerbating poverty, thus making resolution of the problem by a catastrophe ultimately inevitable" n19 p43 of WhyIreSt But that is Mokyr describing test outcome 2 (Y/L falls with R/L but population is nonresponsive to income)



1989 OGrada p38 In the end, whether due to overpopulation or other factors, there is no denying the gradual decline in the living standards of the poor, the bottom half or so of the population before 1845.26 The shock of Phythophthora infestans would have had less of an impact in an economy with a larger margin to spare. (referring to M&OG 1988 EHR)

1988 Mokyr & OGrada EHR,  "Poor and Getting Poorer? Living Standards in Ireland before the Famine"  p211 The Irish poor almost certainly grew poorer during the half century or so before the Famine, but overall average incomes  probably rose. This implies a sharpening of the inequality of income distribution. (end of intro) **Irish GDP** shows increasing pcGDP (average)    p212 1/2 or more are poor.    "what proportion was considered 'poor'?  / A lower bound of three out of over eight million would include those who relied almost exclusively on the potato for food, ...  Other sources indicate a higher proportion  ... upper bound of 60 per cent or more could be defended ...  1841 census division of families into those 'depending on their own manual  labour', those who depended on 'the direction of labour', and those with 'vested means, professions, etc.'. In the country as a whole, the first category  accounted for 62.9 per cent of the total.'2 A safe middle ground would be  the lower half of the income distribution. p213 Table 1 "subjective impoverishment index"  -- (p. 211: responding to questionnaire "Is the general condition of the poorer classes in your parish improved, deteriorated, or stationary, since the peace, (1815))  p215  The results indicate a definite perceived deterioration of the condition of the poorer classes between I8I5 and i835.    p217 province of Connacht "the poorest and most backward" no tea dealers  p221  For consumers of tea, sugar, and tobacco, a net improvement in living standards was taking place.  p222  these proxies indicate that in the longer run improvement was neither  ubiquitous nor steady; the positive trend in tea, sugar, and tobacco consumption conceals long stretches of stagnation and decline, and growing inequality. Yet ironically, in the decade and a half before the Great Famine, still viewed by many as a Malthusian disaster, there is little evidence of severe pressure on living standards, as per caput consumption of tobacco shows an impressive recovery.     p223  A look at schooling and literacy patterns across the country and over time  should therefore provide us with another rough guide to the changes in  living standards p224  a slight rise of school enrolments  p225  The proportion illiterate is one-third higher for the 66-75 age bracket  than the I6-25 bracket. The difference is consistent with a gradual  improvement in literacy levels between the I780s and the i830s. p226  In sum, Ireland was something of an 'impoverished sophisticate', in the  sense that its literacy level was probably higher than its income level would  indicate.50 (Sandberg -- Sweden)  p228 it seems that, rising real wages in Britain notwithstanding, the 'backward' Irish economy did not fall behind in  nutritional status and that there was no substantial difficulty in feeding a  rapidly growing population in Ireland     ...   Nonetheless, the seemingly paradoxical finding that the Irish were as tall  as any other European nation and were possibly growing taller themselves  in a period of economic decline suggests three important points to be kept  in mind by those making use of physical indicators of living standards.  p229  The  much-feared Malthusian spectre was not much visible before i845.    life expectancy at birth of about 38 years, 40 years in contemporary England.62=Boyle & OGrada      Given that Irish infant mortality rates were about 50 per cent higher than in Britain, life expectancy at higher ages was very similar to that in Britain. Estimates of life expectancy at birth elsewhere in Europe are scarce, but we suspect that despite their poverty the Irish lived longer than the European norm.63   p230 In the years before the Famine the Irish were becoming more literate, and were probably growing taller, and they consumed somewhat larger quantities per head of desirable exotic  commodities on the market.   ... In terms of resilience to disasters, the British (p231)  economy was much stronger than the Irish;  ...  the classic pessimist case has insisted instead on a rising inequality which prevented the living standards of the 'poor' or the 'working class' from rising much. The re-integration of Ireland into the economic history of the United Kingdom does not clinch that traditional pessimist case, but it lends it some support

    The 1841 Census Commissioners noted the extensive age-heaping in the recorded figures (Lee 1968:289) and produced their own smoothed age distribution (Great Britain 1843:488-489) ... No indication of how these smoothed or "real" numbers were obtained was given, though it seems a graphical procedure was used. ... For ages 0-10, we used the smoothed age distribution produced by the (p546) Census Commissioners, ... [Wrigley & Schofield 1981 undercount of 0-4 age in 1841 census GB] Several authors, notably Tucker (1970), have also commented on the serious undercounting of children in the 0-2 age group in the 1841 Irish census.  The "real" figures prepared by the Census Commissioners correct for this. These figures are used in our analysis, "  
    
B&OG Table 2 reports "raw" and "smoothed" by age for males; their raw value (103479) is the sum of the male populations at ages 1month through 11months, reported census p488. The "smoothed" value (142481) for age 0 is 37.7% larger than the census value, and their age-1 value is 59.8% larger; their age 2 value is the same as that of the census (and older ages differ via smoothing).

For undercounting of children, Lee refers to Drake 309n4 and Lee says "The Census Commissioners themselves noted the probable under-recording of children." But Drake only notes the data could be flawed; Lee doesn't tell us where the commissioners noted under-recording ... The B&OG Working paper cites Tucker 1970 for undercounting  Irish Fertility Rates before the Famine  
    
p561 infant mortality 1821-41 male 172.9 female 135.2 (male rate 127% of female!)

Census page xlv+ discuss ages and the problem of age-heaping, but they are talking about ages like 20 25 30 35  The census pages cited (488-489) are Table VI, giving pop by month to month 12, then by each year of age from 2-years old. T**those are raw, given the pronounced age heaping.**  91page lxxxiii has the census "actual" which is the smoothed series -- But   . The monthly data are not smoothed.    

NOTE that the working paper version (Boyle & OGrada 1983) has the life tables they come up with.   Boyle & Grada (1983) Working Paper -- see the 1986 Demography paper

Tucker 1970 argues for massive undercount of kids at ages 0 and 1 (and B&OG present numbers that greatly inflate those values, but I can't figure out where they got the inflated values -- they attribute the smoothing to the commissioners, but the commissioners data don't bump up the count of under twos.)

Lee 1968:289  -- is about age heaping (not about monthly stuff).

Mokyr 1983:9  says 

     Kane (1845, pp. 400-1) reported that the average height of the Irish was 70 inches, compared to 68 5 inches for the English and 68 inches for the Belgians.    
But reading Kane, we see that he was not saying typical Irish were taller, but referring to University of Edinburgh students -- well-fed people.  p400 "when at all well fed, there is no race more perfectly developed as to physical conformation, than the inhabitants of this island." His discussion comes after saying p397 "That human labour can be obtained in this country on lower terms than almost any other in Europe, is too well known to require example.  ...  this nominal cheapness is, however, by no means necessarily economy in the final cost. A wretched man who can earn, by his exertion, but 4s or 5s a week, ... must be so ill fed, and depressed in mind, that to work, as a man should work, is beyond his power. Hence there are often seen about employments in this country a number of hands, double what would be required to do the same work, in the same time, with British labourers.

p48   land appears to have been less of a binding constraint on the Irish economy than the "overpopulation" view would have us believe. 
p53 The crude Malthusian model which sets population change as a function of economic variables is wholly inappropriate

Mokyr & OGrada (EEH 1982) cite Mokyr's IMR of 220 "50% higher than England, France, the Low Countries of Scandinavia" pretty pessimistic view, albeit some attention to "relatively well fed and healthy, though poorly clothed and housed" "leisure and children represented forms of consumption" ... but "in the first half of the 19th C there was little economic progress in Ireland"   Note they cite Mokyr as 1982 forthcoming --

Lee (1968 EHR) "Marriage and population in pre-famine Ireland" attacks Drake's (1963) take on the 1841 census and Connell's work. Important for us is pessimist view of Irish diet and health (implicitly) in the 1830s ...    

     p291 IV That the fertility of Irish wives in the i830's was much the same as among the  older-marrying Norwegians is puzzling.5 Dr Drake recognizes that this may be  simply due to faulty Irish statistics,6 {6 Ibid=Drake p. 309, n. i. The Census Commissioners themselves noted the probable under-recording of children.} but the problem nevertheless warrants a reconsideration of the nutritional value of the potato. Dr Connell's conclusion that  the diet was more than adequate assumes a daily per capita consumption of 10 lb.  of potatoes and one pint of milk. It does not take into account the two "meal  months" between the old and the new potatoes, when the labourer lived in a  state of semi-starvation, nor does it make any allowance for the worsening of the  quality of the potatoes, the watery lumper having replaced better types in the  labourers' diet by 1815. The per capita consumption of milk almost certainly de-clined in the half-century before the Famine, when the pig displaced the cow as  the cottiers' most prized possession.  It seems likely that fertility in the 1830's,  when local potato failure was endemic, and the quality of the diet at its worst were lower than a generation or two earlier.

The decline of mortality between 1870 and 1914 was widespread in large cities across the North Atlantic economies (Costa and Kahn, 2015). The sharp reduction of mortality occurred in the U.S. (Cutler and Miller, 2005; Troesken, 1999), in Germany (Brown, 1989), and in the U.K. (Szreter, 1988) among other countries. This decline initially allowed urban mortality to reach parity with that of rural areas, which had long enjoyed a health advantage (Woods, 2003). Urban mortality then continued to fall, finally giving cities the life expectancy advantage over rural areas they currently enjoy (including in the developing world, see Bocquier et al., 2011). </p>

Historical demographers in Europe and elsewhere have called attention to the changing relation-ship between infant, childhood, and adult mortality over the course of the nineteenth century (Woods 1993). It is unlikely that the United States was an exception. Empirical research on infant and childhood mortality in the United States is sorely needed. Source material, however, remains a major issue.

<br>p33 In the United States in the XIXth century, as in Europe in that era, there was a substantial mortality “penalty” to living in urban places (e.g., Williamson, 1982, 1990, ch. 9; Davis, 1973; Weber, 1899, ch 6; Brown, 1991; Vögele, 1994). By 1940, that urban penalty had  been largely eliminated; and it was healthier, in many cases, to reside in a city than in the countryside. Part of the study of the great mortality transition in the United States is related to this phenomenon.    
<br>A significant problem with the history of mortality in the United States stems from the paucity of good statistical information—on levels, trends, and differentials. It is possible, however, using a variety of sources and demographic estimation methods, partially to reconstruct the course of mortality in the United States from 1800 onwards and, more particularly, to provide some insight into differentials. When census data, vital statistics, local records, and genealogical data are culled for what they can reveal, the outlines appear.   
<br>p34 In the early XIXth century, the U S was a relatively low mortality region by the standards of Western Europe. Since it was not particularly urban (only 6.1% in 1800), a crude death rate in the range of 20-25 per 1,000 population would not have been unusual. 
  ... Mortality was likely lowest in New England and rose as the latitude moved further south. Such evidence as we have (mostly for New England the Middle Atlantic states) does indicate a substantial urban penalty ... 1900 within Death Reg Area (six New England states (MASS, CT, VT, ME, NH, RI), NY, PA, MI, IN, DC)   URB PENALTY 1900 IPUMS-based suggest

<br>p35 For the seven states with reasonable registration data in both 1890 and 1900, the ratio of urban to rural overall CDR ... in 1890 census 1.32 ... 1.17 in 1900 (See Table 2). Concernig the death rates for young children (aged 1-4) the ratios were much higher, with urban mortality being 94% higher in 1890 and 100% higher in 1900. For infants the excess urban mortality was 88% in 1890 and 48% in 1900.    ... The rural urban differential seems to have been true earlier as well. For seven New York counties in 1865, the probability of dying before reaching age five was .229 in urban areas but .192 in rural locations (Haines, 1977).   
NOTICE: small differential of 1865 -- we should consider 1890 ...
<br>p36 Given the paucity of vital statistics data in the XIXth century, it is difficult to describe the process of the mortality transition. One place to start is with city vital registration.  ... One must conclude that large American cities had become virtual charnel houses by the middle of the XIXth century and that this contributed notably to the rising mortality in the United States before the American Civil War. 

BTW 1890 and 1900 census volumes show fairly benign SR5 values, 

<br>p41 The rural advantage seems simply to have been that rural residents were farther from each other, reducing chances of contagion and contamination of water supplies.  ...  Also, the XXth century mortality decline was significantly propelled by the elimination of excess urban deaths (Preston
and Haines, 1991, 36-39; Taeuber and Taeuber, 1958, 274-275).

<br>Urban mortality rates, for example, remained high for some time after
rural mortality rates had begun their decline (Condran and Crimmins, 1980; Higgs, 1973; Knodel, 1977)
<br> Throughout the time period from 1870 to 1930, the mortality regime in Philadelphia was characterized by crude death rates which were high and fluctuating from year to year. Some of the fluctuation may have been due to the inadequacy of the extrapolated population figures or the death register, but much can probably be explained by genuine shifts in the levels of infectious disease from one year to the next. A decline in the crude death rates occurred between 1890 and 1900. The crude death rate of 23/1000 in 1892 was not surpassed again except during the influenza epidemic of 1918

p4  In essence, this article argues that the tremendous catch-up growth experienced by slaves is inconsistent with Steckel’s assertion that slave birth weights, a proxy for health in utero, were incredibly low. Adaptive theories of human growth suggest that poor conditions in utero have long-lasting effects on the growth pattern of children, especially in limiting catch-up growth. Thus, it is more likely that slave children experienced relatively good conditions in utero and had higher birth weights than Steckel argued.

## Sex-Ratios and Sex-Discrimination: Testing for Excess Girl Mortality -- maybe a separate paper?

  **SR1-5 or 5-9? **^[The Indian data often does not work for SR1-based sex-discrim test. The 1891 census gives SR01 SR04 (yes, the first is part of the second) and SR59. The SR01-SR04 is mostly inconclusive, but I suspect that is because Indian SR1 is very noisy (see 1891 Appendix p. vi ([pdf 295](https://www.dropbox.com/s/18d5blekfq3wurl/India1891CensusPp247%2C295.pdf?dl=0)) ), mostly because the age-1 populations look bizarre, at just 53% the size of the age-0 populations.]   
  
Comparing a population's sex ratios in infancy and childhood (e.g. ages 1-4) offers a powerful one-sided test for extremes of gender discrimination that cause excess mortality among girls.^["extremes" because there are so many varieties of gender discrimination, and many of which would be unlikely to cause excess female mortality that would show up in population statistics] It is definitely a one-sided test, because the mere fact that the SR5 is below (or near) the SR1 does not rule out various forms of misogynstic gender-discrimination. ^[Indeed, one could imagine quite egregious patterns of discrimination against girls which would not leave a footprint in the sex-ratio evidence.]   
  (societal misogny? a term to use?)  
However, if we find a population where the SR5 is substantially greater than the SR1, we have a strong evidence of sex-discrimination that killed girls -- sex-discrimination in the form of "selective neglect" of girls, or of female infanticide more narrowly.^[The term "selective neglect" refers to "a withdrawal of care and attention ... sufficient to kill an infant or young child" (Scheper-Hughes, 1987: 14). Referring to such behavior, Lynch (2011) uses instead the term "mortal neglect", from Scheper-Hughes (1992:20,343). However, Lynch's usage does not fit well with Scheper-Hughes' concept, which is to "the mortal neglect of certain presumed-to-be-doomed babies" (1992:20). The girls who suffered from sex-selective neglect were not otherwise doomed. Indeed, recalling male infants' biological mortality disadvantage, natural mortality risks would tend to leave male babies, more than females, subject to "mortal neglect."] Absent extreme forms of misogynst gender-discrimination, the SR5 in a population will tend to be somewhat lower than the SR1, because mortality risks are "naturally" greater for boys than girls.^[Absent extremes of gender-discrimination, the sex-ratio tends to decrease with age, until women start having children. The effects will be more apparent when mortality among the young is high. Population growth would only accentuate the process of a diminishing sex-ratio with age, because population growth would tend to pump up the SR1, increasing the weight of the very young, and the very young are the most male (the effects of male-biased infant mortality showing up as age increases)]. Even allowing for well-intentioned behaviours seeking to mediate the male mortality disadvantage, it is difficult to come up with a story to generate a pattern of increasing sex-ratios with age that does not include excess female mortality from misogynisticsex-discrimination.  



Although the biological mechanisms driving sex-differences in infant mortality may be mediated by "adaptive responses" (or human agency more generally), it seems clear that biology leaves boys more vulnerable than girls to a range of diseases and hazards, so that absent sex discrimination, infant and child mortality among girls tends to be lower than among boys.    


### The Fallacy of the SR1 as a test for excess female mortality 
Recognizing a low value of the SR1 as a powerful indicator of deleterious living conditions for pregnant women and infants, it is tempting to suggest that a not-low value of the SR1 could be an indicator of gender discrimination -- if the not-low SBR is found in a population known to exist with poor living conditions and high rates of infant and fetal mortality. In a society of general material deprivation (poor nutrition, poor health, and a general lack of "the necessaries and conveniences of life"^[[Malthus 1798, Ch. 16:](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/malthus/ch16.htm) "I do not mean to enter into a philosophical discussion of what constitutes the proper happiness of man, but shall merely consider two universally acknowledged ingredients, health, and the command of the necessaries and conveniences of life.]), we expect to find the SR1 to be low -- parity perhaps. If we observe an SR1 greater than expected, we might conclude we have evidence of excess mortality of female infants. However, with a little attention to theory and evidence it becomes clear that looking for unexpectedly high SR1 values is a very weak test for excess female mortality -- a test for gender discrimination that affects relative survival prospects of girls and boys. 

Although one might be tempted to draw inferences about gender discrimination from comparisons of the SR1 (or other sex ratios for childhood), across societies and time, tests based on SR1 comparisons are weak, especially in relation to likely noise in the underlying data and uncertainties about infant mortality rates and other demographic parameters.   




#### Literature for vocab of misogynistic sex-discrimination

Lynch (2011 Hi Fam^[Lynch, K.A., 2011. Why weren’t (many) European women “missing”? Hist. Fam. 16, 250–266.]. p251 This article enters the discussion of the “missing women” question using Sen's work and the research of others on Asia to compare with evidence on the disadvantaging or even “mortal neglect” (Scheper-Hughes, 1992) of girls or the disadvantaging of women in western European society in the early modern and modern periods — roughly from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries" nineteenth centuries. Like Sen's essay, it is not concerned with “sexism” or the simple subordination of females of all ages to males. Rather, it addresses both  Rather, it addresses both the intensive disadvantaging that resulted directly in the actual deaths of females, particularly as babies or as young girls; and the disadvantaging of women later in life as evidenced by rates of mortality higher than those of men. Although the mortal neglect of babies and young girls and the disadvantaging of adolescent and mature women may appear together, they are not necessarily or inextricably intertwined. Some might argue that any kind of inequality or subordination, whether between men and women or between social classes, is bound to result in unequal chances of survival. This is doubtless true in modern settings where differential access to effective medical care can be extreme and heavy with consequences for those excluded from it. However, in historic western Europe, it is not clear that the wealthy, for example, enjoyed significantly higher life expectancies than the poor until the relatively recent past, since so much mortality was attributable to infectious disease over which medical practitioners had little control (LiviBacci, 1990). Widespread, significant variations in life expectancy at birth by social class status began to appear in the European record by the late eighteenth century, mainly in large urban settings (Bardet, 1983; Blum, Houdaille, & Lamouche, 1990; Perrenoud, 1979).


#### Selective Neglect vs Mortal Neglect
Mortal Neglect (S-H 1992)  
Selective: S-H 1987, and probably by others earlier? ...

Scheper-Hughes coins the term "mortal neglect" in her 1992 book, for a "pattern I first (and rather unfortunately) labeled "ethnoeugenic selective neglect" (Scheper-Hughes 1984 :540). Today I simply call it "mortal neglect. " 

Scheper-Hughes (1992)^[^[Nancy Scheper-Hughes, *Death Without Weeping: The Violence of Everyday Life in Brazil*, Berkeley and Los Angeles, Univ of California Press, 1992.] p. 343:

    Later, I learned that the high expectancy of death and the ability to face death with stoicism and equanimity produced patterns of nurturing that differentiated those infants thought of as "thrivers" and as "keepers" from those thought of as born "already wanting to die. " The survivors and keepers were nurtured, while the stigmatized or "doomed" infants were allowed to die a mfngua, "of neglect." Mothers sometimes stepped back and allowed nature to take its course. This pattern I first (and rather unfortunately) labeled "ethnoeugenic selective neglect" (Scheper-Hughes 1984 :540). Today I simply call it "mortal neglect. "

1992 p20 "Chapter 8  ...  also treats the subject of women's morality by examining close up the triage-based choices that women of the Alto must make; these choices lead to the mortal neglect of certain presumed-to-be-doomed babies."

Linger [review (1993 AmEthnologist)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/646234): 

    Alto women's "mortal neglect" of doomed infants -- a practice of "letting go"  characterized by seeming motherly indifference to the flight of the angel-babies, the anjinhos-- is a major topic of this book.

Scheper-Hughes (1987)^[Nancy Scheper-Hughes (editor), Child Survival: Anthropological Perspectives on the Treatment and Maltreatment of Children, Reidel, 1987.]
p7 Infanticide, incest, selective neglect have once again come into the public arena of anthropological discourse (Hausfater and Hrdy 1984; Korbin, ed. 1981; McKee 1984; Rohner 1975). 
p14

     In much of the contemporary world today the traditional practice of direct infanticide is proscribed by law, by religious authority, or both. The same end-point is reached, albeit more gradually, in the semi-covert practice of selective or "benign" neglect (Scrimshaw 1978; Cassidy 1980). A withdrawal of care and attention is generally sufficient to kill an infant or young child in poorer and tropical areas of the world, where many natural threats to child survival abound and where a constant parental vigilance is necessary to keep infants and toddlers alive. Marvin Harris (1977: 5) refers to selective neglect as passive infanticide. 

Sidenote -- Scheper-Hughes (1987) tends toward the view that infant mortality was class-based, which is about opposite to Lynch's view.    

    childhood mortality had a clear social class reference which allowed it to remain masked for many generations" ... offers a different view:  In short, the social construction of child survival as a medical problem about which something can and should be done is fairly recent.4 In many pockets of the western world up through the mid- to late-19th century childhood mortality tended to be viewed as an unfortunate but altogether predictable natural occurrence, and a 15% to 20% morality rate during the first year of life was not regarded as intolerable or unacceptable. For one thing, childhood mortality had a clear social class reference which allowed it to remain masked for many generations. The pernicious living and working conditions of the urban proletariat during the first half of the 19th century corresponded to the lack of social and medical concern for the mortality of working-class and underclass children. As Foucault writes, "It was of little importance whether these people lived or died, since their reproduction was [thought of] as something that took care of itself in any case" (1978: 126). 
She also (p 11) suggests "In rural Ireland up through the 19th century, deformed, sickly, or wasted infants were sometimes killed in the open fireplace or left exposed as "fairy children" (see Scheper-Hughes 1982: 143)."    
And p14 

    In much of the contemporary world today the traditional practice of direct infanticide is proscribed by law, by religious authority, or both. The same end-point is reached, albeit more gradually, in the semi-covert practice of selective or "benign" neglect (Scrimshaw 1978; Cassidy 1980). A withdrawal of care and attention is generally sufficient to kill an infant or young child in poorer and tropical areas of the world, where many natural threats to child survival abound and where a constant parental vigilance is necessary to keep infants and toddlers alive. Marvin Harris (1977: 5) refers to selective neglect as passive infanticide. In keeping with this view I would classify as "infanticide-tolerant" those segments of contemporary societies in North India (Miller, this volume), Mexico (Mull and Mull, this volume), and Northeast Brazil (Scheper-Hughes, this volume) in which the gradual wasting away and death of certain infants is not identified as a social problem, nor are aggressive (or public) efforts made to rescue the vulnerable children or to chastise their parents. It is important to note that passive infanticide is difficult to recognize and identify, since it rarely exists apart from other, more "natural" threats to the child's survival (infectious disease, poor sanitation, inadequate diet, etc.). In addition, passive infanticide and selective or benign neglect involve neither direct violence nor hostility toward the child. Rather, parental expressions of pity for the inadequate or supernumerary infant often predominate. Parental implication in the death of their infants involves, in this case, acts of omission, rather than acts of commission, such as failing to note or respond to signs of malnutrition, dehydration and other serious threats to survivability. Deaths from selective neglect are gradual and always compounded with other exogenous causes.

    Loss of the labor of females after marriage has been suggested as a contributing factor to "selective neglect" of female offspring, female infanticide, and a resulting imbalance in the sex ratio in some patrilineal, virilocal societies with dense populations (Scrimshaw 1978, Wyon and Gordon 1971, Miller 1981)

    Some of the strongest evidence comes from societies that greatly  favor children of one sex over the other.26 In such societies, differential  care leading to differential male-female mortality rates is not uncommon.  India provides an example of unexpectedly high female infant mortality  rates. One of the first studies to point out this differential infant mortality  in India was the Khanna study, which found that boys receive more food  and medical care than girls27 and that in the first five years of life the  female death rate was 74 per thousand per year while the male death rate  was 50.28 Finis Welch reports a similar finding in Bangladesh, where a  girl is more likely to survive in a family with more boys than girls.9

    highland Ecuador  ...  While people in the village would not  discuss this openly, several in-depth anthropological studies in the same  region indicated that female neglect or even infanticide occurred occasionally and that it was considered very important that the first child be male  ...  Differential male and female infant mortality in effect permits sex  selection: children of the desired sex may receive more attention, food,  and other resources that improve their chances for survival.31 The factor  of sex selection through differential care, no matter how unconscious,  offers the chance to influence the sex composition of the couple's living  children as no other currently practical method can.

Francisco J. Marco-Gracia and Johan Fourie, Nov 2019 [Missing boys: Explaining South Africa’s unbalanced sex ratio, 1894-2011](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francisco_Marco-Gracia/publication/337657133_Missing_boys_Explaining_South_Africa's_unbalanced_sex_ratio_1894-2011/links/5de3a7f892851c8364583870/Missing-boys-Explaining-South-Africas-unbalanced-sex-ratio-1894-2011.pdf)
p1     When the first articles on African sex ratios were published, the (p2) Statistical Offices found very low sex ratios for the under-five populations in various countries around the continent, ... 
    They expected to find that sex ratios under five years were over 100 (more boys than girls) ... We are not the first to document this. In the Preliminary Report of the 1963 Census of Northern Rhodesia (Northern Rhodesia Government 1964: 5-6), one observer wrote: 

    In most populations more males are born than females but as male mortality is higher than female mortality there are normally more females than males in all age groups except at very young age where an excess of males can reasonably be expected. This has been true of most Western nations but it has yet to be confirmed for underdeveloped African conditions. [. . . ] It is interesting, however, to find that this peculiarity was observed in the 1962 Census of Africans in Southern Rhodesia, the 1960 Census of Tanganyika and in a recent sample survey of Swaziland. It is evident that unless there is an inherent bias in reporting sex and ages which is peculiar to Africa that accepted beliefs about the sex ratio at birth and differential mortality must be revised.
This suggests that census authorities, at least as far back as the mid-twentieth century, were aware of the missing boys of Africa. These census takers were not wrong in their initial estimations. In contrast to the rest of the world, we show, sub-Saharan countries during the twentieth century had a very low sex ratio of the under-five population, and these values are not explained by different sex ratios at birth or erroneous data.    ...  We analyse whether these extremely low values, lower than those of preindustrial and nineteenth-century Europe ... (p3) can be explained exclusively by the boysígreater likelihood of dying or if there could be other complementary factors. Our initial hypothesis is that there existed gender preferences associated with social traditions and customs that conditioned family behaviour. The existence of a preference for girls in traditional African societies, we argue, had implications for social systems (such as the prevalence of the brideprice) and for the greater number of girls than boys in the censuses.
    (p3) In this paper we argue that the important role played by women in African societies was largely responsible for the demographic pattern of gender discrimination. This research therefore provides a novel explanation for the unbalanced sex ratios based on gender preferences. Our Öndings help us not only to identify the possible causes of the anomalously low African sex ratio but also to explain several demographic and social trends in South Africaís black population today.
    THEY use UNDER-5 sex ratio -- Lesotho 1946 96.2 1966 98.1  THEY mention Garenne 2004, 2002 for Bantu low SR from Bantu genetics      p4 Our study was based on the South African censuses of 1911, 1921, 1936, 1946, 1951, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1991, 2001 and 2011. We selected these ones because of their variety of information (all of them include the black population)  ... p6  black sex ratios, which remain below 100 for almost the whole period, dropping to figures close to 90 in the Örst decades of the twentieth century.
     The biological explanation for these low sex ratios is that boys are weaker than girls during the Örst years of life (Vaupel et al. 1979; Wisser and Vaupel 2014). However, the South African sex ratios are extremely low, even in comparison with pre-industrial and nineteenth-century Europe (Mitchell 2013; Beltr·n Tapia and G·llego-MartÌnez 2017)
     In our sample of black South Africans, the low sex ratios remain almost constant from one to four years. This would suggest that no e§orts were made to reverse the e§ects of the boysíexcess mortality in the Örst months of life, which would provide further supporting evidence for our hypothesis that there was a cultural preference for girls   OUCH -- Table 5 actually displaysshows the Blacks' sex ratios in 1980/84 (1980 census, presumably)

Note from [Plowden's Report on the census of India ... 1881](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/012155211)  (1883 p. 53)

     In the Registrar General's Report of births, deaths, and marriages, in 1880, for England, the male births are given as 103.6 to 100 births of girls, and the following remarks are made:—  "There are two curious facts relating to this proportion of male and female birth, neither of which has as yet received certain explanation. The first is, that the proportion of boys to girls is smaller in England and Wales than in any other European country; and the second, that the proportion has been gradually but steadily diminishing for many years past. Comparing England and Wales with other countries, we have the following figures, which give the average number of male births to 100 female births for the 10 years 1870—79, or for those years out of the 10 for which the necessary statistics are forthcoming:—  "As regards the other point, the following figures show the gradual diminution in England and Wales of male as compared with female births:

Great quotation about SBR 106 and the frail male "At birth 106 males appear for every 100 females ...; yet, by the law of nature, -- a law seen in still more powerful operation even in intra uterine life -- the tendency to succumb under disease is so much greater in the male than in the female, that by about the 18th year of life the proportion of the sexes becomes equalized, 100 males being alive at that age for every 100 females"

The Bulletin of the WHO, [2000, 78:1175-1191](https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(10)1175.pdf)   
U% mortality rate ... has a number of advantages over the infant mortality rate as a composite measure of health risks
at young ages. In particular, the indirect demographic techniques for measuring the under-five mortality rate are more robust and less sensitive to assumptions about the underlying patterns of mortality than the infant mortality rate (28, 29)

Data obtained from the complete registration of births and deaths provide the best possible basis for the direct estimation of child mortality. Unfortunately, such data are available for only 55–60 countries.d

To think about: if 11mo olds are rounded up, how does that distort the SR1? It would seem to leave more of the younger, who are more male ...

### US Census for the Black SR1 ###
population volumes from 1850 and 1860 give U1, 1-u5, 5-u10 etc, for Whites, Free Colored Slaves.  Negro Population 1790-1915 Ch 4 provides SR1 for blacks 1850, 1860, 1870, 1900, 1910 and explains that 1880 and 1890 includes "indians, chinese, japanese" with blacks. So we need to extrapolate to fill in -- calculate non-white totals 

1940 can't find negro age 2 -- just nonwhite for single yr

#### Time-series for Englnd
Our british estimates: we accept 1901 forward from
[S92 NatArchives Database](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11521415). That 1901 value is 100.1 and we extrapolate back, based on the 1911 census Table 43, back from 1901 to 1861. CLRIFY THIS: 1911 census has 102.2 (graduated) and 102.1 (Table 43), both close to the S92 value of 102.0;  1901 value of 100.5 (1911Tab43,1901Tab16) 1901 census has 100.6 as the graduated estimate, 100.5 as the value Tab16 via fems/thousand males age 0, in 1901 and 1911 census.  
1861 PUMS 101.2; 1861 volumes have 100.7; 1911/1901 101.5 Notion that 1861 misses boys ...  1851 estimated midyear is 100.7 vs 1861's ; We extrapolate via 1861 1851 1841 (risk overstating 1841, but it is so low, we can accept?)  
1851 and 1841 will be extrapolates from 1861.

Also, [HistPop](http://www.histpop.org) has census data fairly conveniently (although it is often busy); might want to look at it compared to the "official" stats?

London 1841 is given with and without Lewisham and Hempstead -- probably more rural-like, but too small to matter
"Original homelots were not divided up extensively until the 1840s, when enriched by the burgeoning whaling industry, New Londoners began to seek land for dwelling houses in outlying neighborhoods close to the center of town."
From Wikipedia The Official Illustrated Guide to South-Eastern and North and Mid-Kent Railways of June 1863, by George Measom, describes Lewisham as follows: 'Lewisham Station, situated on the slope of an eminence amidst picturesque scenery, beautiful green meadows rising abruptly to the summit of the hill on the left, dotted with handsome residences and gardens, while the Common is seen intersected by various cross roads and studded with country inns and houses on the low ground or valley to the right. The area of the parish is 5,789 acres... Lord of the manor, the Earl of Dartmouth to whom it gives the title Viscount'.  


#### **1841**
 Census results published in 1849 registrar-general report, which gives population by sex and one-year intervals; 1841 abstract table III under5

From 1881 census (Plowden p. 54)   
    the actual disproportion between the sexes, though it might exist to some extent, and to what extent it was impossible then to say, was not anything like so great as had hitherto been portrayed by the census statistics.
 ... the nearer we approach to accuracy in the Census of a general population, the more clearly does the fact appear that there is nothing peculiar in this country in the proportion of the sexes; that if there are from 104 to 106 females to every hundred males in Europe, this proportion also obtains in India, that is in all parts of the country where female infanticide is unknown. The truth is that the great bulk of enumerators have been singularly obtuse in comprehending the fact that the counting of females was a matter of any importance in census work. To understand how this is, we must take into account **the low estimation in which females are held in this country,** and also the reticence of the people on all matters connected with their female relatives. In the registration of births and deaths the same error obtains. **The birth or death of a female child is considered such an insignificant matter,** especially among the lower classes of the population, that a great number escape registration in certain districts; and, from the causes adverted, to the numbering of the female population in 1871 was undoubtedly erroneous in so far that many were omitted in the Census schedules. But in districts where the Census work was well done it will be found that the female population is invariably in excess of the male; in fact, the general accuracy of the results of any district may be judged of by the way in which the proportions of the sexes have been recorded."

p178  It is obvious that a wave of infecundity has during the last few years swept over at least Northern India, and that the five years between 1876 and 1881 have seen a far smaller number of births than took place between 1871 and 1875.

These observational studies lead to inconsistent findings regarding whether poor maternal nutritional conditions reduce the proportion of male births among human. One possible explanation for the inconsistent results is omitted variable bias.     ....     
p2888 That the abrupt decline in the proportion of male births first occurred to those who were conceived more than half a year after the famine began suggests that the earlier studies based on the Dutch Hunger Winter and Leningrad Siege failed to recover consistent evidence regarding the relationship between maternal famine exposure and offspring sex ratio at birth because the duration of the famines was insufficient.

Cites Waldron to back up nice summary statement of infant-female survival advantage:    

      Equity in survival between females and males does not imply equal mortality rates (that is, male-to-female ratios equal to 100). Under circumstances where boys and girls have the same access to resources such as food and medical care, boys have higher mortality rates than girls during childhood, and the examined ratios would overall be expected to be greater than 100.
And she continues, explaining the bio advantage.^[Newborn girls have a biological advantage in survival over newborn boys, with lesser vulnerability to perinatal conditions (including birth trauma, intrauterine hypoxia and birth asphyxia, prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal tetanus), congenital anomalies, and such infectious diseases as intestinal infections and lower respiratory infections [4]. However, beyond early infancy, girls do not enjoy the same advantage in relation to certain infectious diseases, which are the primary causes of death in later infancy and early childhood in settings where overall mortality is high [5],[6]. Thus, the sex ratio of child mortality (that is, mortality at ages 1–4 y) is generally lower than the sex ratio of infant mortality (Figure 1).]   And has useful statement re: missing women^[Earlier studies have found numerous countries in many regions of the world, particularly southern Asia, eastern Asia, and northern Africa/western Asia, where mortality at ages 1–4 y was higher for girls than for boys [1],[10],[11]. India and China in particular have a long-documented history of female disadvantage in mortality that is covered in an extensive literature [12]–[25].]

    Our analysis of 15 developed countries shows that, as infant mortality declined over two centuries, the excess male mortality increased from 10% in 1751 to >30% by approximately 1970. Remarkably, since 1970, the male disadvantage in most countries fell back to lower levels. The worsening male disadvantage from 1751 until 1970 may be due to differential changes in cause-specific infant mortality by sex.

MIXED FINDINGS FOR OUR VIEW (some are nonsupportive, not falsifying -- they get a reduced SBR via high-carbo low-sat-fat diet)
 In particular, a diet high in saturated fats but low in carbohydrate leads to the birth of significantly more male than female offspring in mature laboratory mice, whereas when calories are supplied mainly in the form of carbohydrate rather than fat, daughters predominate. As the diets fed to the mice in these experiments were nutritionally complete and because litter sizes did not differ between treatments, dietary inadequacy seems not to be the cause for sex-ratio distortion.      
     Large ruminants
The prediction that females in better body condition would produce more male than female progeny has been observed in red deer [14, 22, 23], roe deer [24], mature ewes [25], reindeer [26], Barbary sheep [27], domestic pigs [28], and a number of other species, although there are exceptions [13, 29]. Dairy cows, but not heifers, on a high plane of nutrition give birth to proportionately more bull than female calves than cows on a poorer diet [30]. Repeat breeder cows, i.e., ones that have problems becoming pregnant by artificial insemination, also tend to produce more males [31]. The data on roe deer [24] were obtained with farmed animals on a diet controlled for low- and high-energy intake by varying the oil content. In that study, 75% of the calves born to the high-energy does were male, while the low-energy group produced only 46% males. Most other studies have been performed on wild populations, which are less well-controlled.

Jongbloet attacks -- This runs parallel with optimization of the ovulatory and conception pattern, as argued extensively elsewhere (Jongbloet, 2004a,b), e.g. in ameliorating socio-economic conditions, during prime reproductive age and prime ovulatory seasons, optimal restoration of the post-partum ovulatory pattern, etc. In contrast, male-biased conceptuses occur in the less optimal conditions, while SSR reduction occurs only in extremely unfavourable conditions, and only then as a consequence of inappropriate implantation and perishing male-biased pathological fetuses    .... Analogous SSR reversal associated with reduction in fertility is also elicited by other severe population stressors, such as a bombing attack in Croatia

Jongbloet attacks ... "The conclusion of Cagnacci et al.

1994 Klasen (1994 World Dev)  Strong statement of SBR rising with income/SES and implicitly, with economic development.    
Klasen (1994) gives us 1980 Matzdorff 1971 Teitelbaum & Mantel; and via Google, Winston 1931 AmJSoc: p12 "prenatal mortality is heavier for the male"  pp20-21 "The sex-ratio of man at  (21) birth is a resultant of the sex-ratio at conception, such sex-ratio constantly being reduced by a prenatal mortality which bears more heavily upon the male than upon the female fetus. This mortality is importantly affected by social factors which operate indirectly through affecting the mother’s ability to provide the necessary optimum conditions for survival.    
Klasen also useful for West Life Table understates male IMR disadvantage   p1064 "Coale’s “West” Table assume that the survival disadvantage of boys is comparatively modest.”10 (n10: at LE=40 West Table male "the absolute disadvantage in the male probability to die in infancy is 29.7/1000. In the Model Life Tables “East” used below the disadvantage is much larger, namely 36.5/1000.)  But, once again, this assumption is likely to be a peculiarity of the countries that make up the “West” Tables and could be a result of preferential treatment for male infants rather than the “natural” state of affairs. The higher fragaility of male infants is likely to lead to a particularly large biological disadvantage in a high mortality environment so that in those populations the sex ratio of mortality in infancy should be higher (Waldron 1983, 1985, 1987)." Waldron sex-differences in mortality. Probably Waldron 1993 for Euro men higher mortality via drink/drive/violence     
Klasen 1994 Emphasis on SBR increase with SES. "The biomedical literature suggests that the reduction in stillbirths and late fetal mortality alone could account for these increases." For a discussion, see McKeown and Lowe (1951) and Klasen (1994b).   ...  See Teitelbaum and Mantel (1971) and Matzdorff (1980)

After considering excess female mortality in ages 1-9, Klasen (p1064) says    
      
      A second and much larger question relates to the size of the male-female mortality differential in infancy. There is little doubt that in infancy boys have a clear survival disadvantage vis-d-vis girls (Preston, 1976; Lancaster, 1990; Waldron, 1987).

ABSTRACT However, stratification of a sample  by socioeconomic indicators shows that white infant male and female  postneonatal mortality rates converge as the mothers' or parents'  education rises and as the mothers age.
p285 ...  Present findings can be seen as congruent with a theory of sex-biased parental investment.
p286  ... boys fare relatively best among the most advantaged families. Where girls have a mortality advantage in general, as in the United States, improved survival for boys means that the disparity between the sexes virtually disappears when the top echelon of society is reached ...
p288  A plausible challenge to the sociobiological interpretation of the present findings is that the convergence of infant boys' and girls' mortality in the high social status sector occurs because of the female physiological advantage and because child rearing at this pinnacle is so good. That is, the marginal gains still possible for girls are nearly zero, whereas boys, who are more vulnerable (Abramowicz and Barnett 1970; Khoury et al.  1985; Naeye et al. 1971; Yip et al. 1985; McMillen 1979), can still derive  significant incremental benefit from the best care

Among the  23 values of sex ratios at birth  below 104,  15 pertain  to populations with more than  one-third  of  the total  classified  as negro,  black  or African,  and colored or mixed. In  the light  of  other  historical evidence on the sex ratio at birth  among the  negroid  populations,  one is  led to conclude  that  there  operates, among the negroid  populations,  some genetic  or ra-cial factor  making for a slightly lower sexratio  at  birth  than  among  the non-negroid  populations.

ABSTRACT Male infants have an excessive risk of neonatal death by comparison with females.   ... inherent biologic disadvantage of being male ... not related to specific disease processes.  ...
The sex ratio for liveborn Caucasians was significantly greater than for nonwhites, and the nonpoor had a significantly greater ratio than the poor. About half of these differences appear related to a greater incidence of prenatal bacterial infections in the poor and nonwhites.  <br>

Teitelbaum (1970 JBiosocSci). Gives long list of factors checked for SRB effects ... "socio-economic status and conditions" are among a long list (32 or more). <br>
p66 finds birth-order effect and race effect  BUT "An important question still remained, however. It was whether either the birth-order effect or the race effect itself could derive from a socio-economic effect for which control could not be provided in the vital data being used. [next is section called <br>
**Socio-economic effects on sex ratio** <br>
Winston (1931), Crew (1948), Russell (1936) (FIND 1921 Reg-Gen DATA), Lawrence (1941). <br>
Crew (1948) extended this proposition from the family to the community level, arguing that if a socio-economic effect is at work, rich communities would be expected to exhibit higher live-birth sex ratios than poor communities.    <br>

In contrast to the above reports, Martin (1948) was unable to find any significant relationship between sex ratio and the socio-economic conditions of the community. He pointed out that there was no apparent upward trend in the sex ratio over the past 100 years in Britain, despite sharp improvements in socioeconomic conditions over that period.  <br>
Bernstein (1948, 1954) higher SRB in upper social strata, and for males in masculine occupations. <br> 
But studies fail to control for birth order or race.  <br>
p68 children born to families in the lowest Socio-economic Index category [Duncan 1961] had approx 8-9% lower odds of being a male than those born to families in the moderate and higher Soc-ec Index categories. [eg 98 vs 106]   ... <br>
If, for example, the mechanism by which socio-economic status affects sex ratio is that of differing standards of nutrition, general health and pre-natal care, we might expect a 'diminishing returns' phenomenon—a limit beyond which 'improvements' in these factors would not be biologically meaningful. A lower-middle-class woman with normal standards of nutrition, health and medical care may be, biologically speaking, no worse off than a wealthy woman attended by the most expensive private specialists. A poor woman would certainly be worse off than both in the United States, where medical care is generally arranged on a private financial basis.
p69 To summarize the findings presented here, only three of the five factors studied appear to be independently related to the sex ratio at birth. The significant negative birth-order effect, which in the first analysis accounted for a 2-6% shift in the relative odds of male birth, remained significant when adjustment for the race effect was provided in the second analysis. The magnitude of the effect was diminished by this adjustment, however, indicating that analysis for birth-order effects in the absence of adjustment for the race factor may lead to over-estimates of the importance of the birth-order factor.

Answers yes. Useful for Savorgnan (1936)who connects SBR to female health p287 As Gini and Savorgnan have pointed out, there is no evidence that a correlation exists between the quantity of nutriment and sex at birth [that in context of malnutrition of mothers claimed to raise SBR in wartime]   p288  Fifth, the most reasonable hypothesis is that of Savorgnan, who  has made the most complete study of the masculinity phenomenon.  This may be called the birth-interval hypothesis. Briefly stated,  Savorgnan maintains that masculinity in births increases in war-time on account of the greater intervals between births, which, in  turn, produces greater rest in the female reproductive system and  thereby brings about the birth of a larger number of males. ...   But how do greater intervals influence the rate of male births?  Savorgnan replies, by producing more prolonged rest and recovery  in the female reproductive organism, which, in turn, reduces the  rate of abortions and stillbirths; and since the proportion of males  in abortions and stillbirths is always higher than that of females, [p289]  the reduction of abortions and stillbirths increases the proportion of males actually born. The effect of stillbirths and abortions in  reducing the rate of male births is well-established in some coun-tries, especially in Germany and Hungary    p920 counterexamples from Egypt and India high SBR and high frequency birth  <br>

LawrencePS (1941 QRBio) p54 "Punnett (1904), who studied the sex ratio in poor and wealthy classes in London concluded that a low masculinity was associated with low social status"  p55 The bulk of the writings indicate that in a general population a high social and economic status is accompanied by a greater proportion of male births than is a low status. Also rural areas demonstrate a higher masculinity than urban districts, at least with respect to European countries. It is quite probable that part of the variation has its basis in differential rates of prenatal mortality, as has frequently been maintained. Bertillon (I875), Alberti (1934), and Taussig (1936) demonstrated that the incidence of reproductive wastage is higher for urban than for rural populations, and thus lend support to this explanation. These studies pertain to Euro data"  Ciocco differ?

p192 The higher male mortality during infancy in part is due to what might be regarded as the extension into post-natal life of the factors responsible for the  high masculinity of stillbirths. Thus  one notes the great difference between  male and female infants relative to the  mortality from prematurity and from injury at birth; both conditions discussed already in the previous section

Winston (1931 AmJSoc). p12 "prenatal mortality is heavier for the male"  pp20-21 "The sex-ratio of man at (21) birth is a resultant of the sex-ratio at conception, such sex-ratio constantly being reduced by a prenatal mortality which bears more heavily upon the male than upon the female fetus. This mortality is importantly affected by social factors which operate indirectly through affecting the mother’s ability to provide the necessary optimum conditions for survival.


Bawkin 1929 Hu Bio p. 90 "The higher mortality of male infants has been a subject of interest for a great many years. In a paper read before the Royal Society of London in 1786, Dr. Joseph Clarke, a Dublin physician, pointed out (91) that the mortality of males exceeds that of females in almost all stages of life and especially in the earliest"

Lenz looks at the correlation between the ratio of male to female mortality rates and "the rate of mortality on both sexes in 11 series of annual rates of mortality for different countries (in most cases the number of years included is very small, 8 or 10, in only one does it exceed 40) and he finds that in the great majority the value of r is large and negative."

p262 Of the various factors which have from time to time been brought forward to account for the determination of sex, that of nutrition appears to have found most favour. That favourable nutritive conditions tend to produce females, and unfavourable conditions males is a hypothesis which has received much support from observation and experiment on numerous forms of life 1 . In the case of the human species, however, strong evidence for or against this view is yet a desideratum. [NOTE: prevailing presumption was better nutrition would reduce the SRB! N1 is Geddes and Thomson, [*Evolution of Sex*](https://archive.org/details/evolutionsex01geddgoog/page/n5/mode/2up), pp. 41-47]<br>
p276 Summary and Conclusion <br>
If the population of London be divided into three portions exhibiting graduated poverty it is found that the proportion of MAL to FEM infants produced is lowest in the poorest portion, highest in the wealthiest portion, and intermediate in the intermediate portion. The proportion of MALs is highest of all in a number of births taken from Burkes Peerage, where the nutrition may be supposed to be of the best. From this the alternative conclusions may be drawn : that either more favourable conditions of nutrition (1) may result in a large proportion of MAL births, or (2) may have no effect on the proportion of the sexes, or (3) may even result in a relative preponderance of FEM births, but that in the last two cases the effect is masked by other factors which affect unequally the different strata of society. Such factors are shewn to exist in a differential infant mortality, a differential birth-rate, and probably also in a differential marriage-age. These factors all tend to diminish the proportion of MALs in the poorer portions of the population, and consequently render the first of the above alternative conclusions improbable. Whether the second or third of the other possible conclusions is to be accepted must remain doubtful so long as we are not in a position to estimate the quantitative effect of the factors given above. From the necessarily rough estimate which he has been able to form, the writer's opinion is that their combined effect would not be sufficiently great to mask a preponderance of FEM births due to better nutrition, and consequently he is inclined to believe that in man at any rate the determination of sex is independent of parental nutrition 1  <br>

The infant mortality rate was 5.79 per 1,000 live births, the neonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants aged 0–27 days per 1,000 live births) was 3.84, and the postneonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants aged 28 days through 11 months per 1,000 live births) was 1.95 in 2017 (Tables C and 13; Figure 7; see Technical Notes for information on alternative data sources). Changes in the infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality rates from 2016 to 2017 were not significant.

Perhaps obviously, the time-pattern of infant deaths affects the SR1, as early deaths pull down the SR (because the excess male births play a smaller role in the cumulative SR1). To illustrate the magnitude of the effect: 23% IMR early-death pattern sees SR drop of 3.4 while even-death pattern has SR drop 2.4; 11% IMR early-death SR drop of 1.6 and even-death SR drop of 1.1. DETAILS: with 104 225(250/200); with my idea of realistic (.5,.15,.14,.1,.1)  104 goes to 100.6; with even 104 to 101.7   OR IMR 113(125/100) 104 to 102.4 vs 104 to 102.9   So the bigger effects occur at higher IMR and higher male excess IMR ...

### Missing Women & Excess Female Mortality ###

Refer to 19th C British Censuses of India


#### Sen, Coale, Klasen 
Sen 1990,1992; 1991 Coale; 1994 Klasen; 2002,2003 Klasen & Wink; 2003 Sen 

2003 Sen shift in source of missing women, from mortality to selective abortion. Interesting for us is the use of SR05 as indicator of missing women. Also India division: N&W missing girls, S&E not.  

Klasen & Wink (2003 Feminist Econ) about same info as 2002? Maybe tone differs: harsher on China; more generally, notion excess fem mort stabilized at a high level
Klasen & Wink (2002 PopDevR).  As in Klasen (1994 World Dev): Coale's (1991) constant SBR overstates expected sex ratios in poor countries (and therefore understates missing women). Some improvement since 1990s. "After significant improvements in Bangladesh and Pakistan, India now has the highest share of missing females among countries for which we have reliable demographic data."  increasing use of sex-selective induced abortion

Klasen (1994 World Dev)  For SBR rising with income/SES and for West Life Table understates male IMR disadvantage   p1064 "Coale’s “West” Table assume that the survival disadvantage of boys is comparatively modest.”10 (n10: at LE=40 West Table male "the absolute disadvantage in the male probability to die in infancy is 29.7/1000. In the Model Life Tables “East” used below the disadvantage is much larger, namely 36.5/1000.)  But, once again, this assumption is likely to be a peculiarity of the countries that make up the “West” Tables and could be a result of preferential treatment for male infants rather than the “natural” state of affairs. The higher fragaility of male infants is likely to lead to a particularly large biological disadvantage in a high mortality environment so that in those populations the sex ratio of mortality in infancy should be higher (Waldron 1983, 1985, 1987)." Waldron sex-differences in mortality. Probably Waldron 1993 for Euro men higher mortality via drink/drive/violence

The paper is utter garbage. They use subsaharan Africa's relatively high death rates of women of child-bearing age to argue for missing women. And US 1900 women are dying in childbirth, creating the appearance of "missing women" there.  GARBAGE  twisting of fact that economic development has hugely reduced maternal death (and that male behavior-based deaths in rich nations is most of male deaths until old-age) ... Consider their calculation of subsaharan missing women age 20-24: their counterfactual (CF) female mortality is via the female/male rate of developed world. Devoloped has death rate (ages 20-24, throughout what follows) for males 2.94 times the female (1.1/0.4); subsahAfr male mortality is 5.7, so CF female mort is 5.7/2.94 or under 2 ... actual female mort is 9.4, so the female mortality among subsaharan women is be 9.4/(5.7/2.94) or  4.85 times actual mort.  And they use UN/WHO death rates for U1 and 1-4 to argue for missing girls in subsaharan Africa. But I bet if we looked at sex-ratios by age we would NOT see evidence of missing girls ... I bet the death rates approach and a sex-ratio approach will give opposite reulsts for subsah africa ...

ABSTR:  ... ; (2) as a proportion of the total female population, the number of missing women is largest in sub-Saharan Africa, and the absolute numbers are comparable to those for India and China; ... Finally, using historical data, we argue that a comparable proportion of women was missing at the start of the 20th century in the United States, just as they are in India, China, and sub-Saharan Africa today.   
1263  For each category—age, and later, age and disease—we posit a “reference” death rate for females, one that would be obtained if the death rate of males in that country were to be rescaled by the relative death rates for males and females (in the same category) in developed countries.6 We subtract this reference rate from the actual death rate for females, and then multiply by the population of females in that category. This is the definition of “missing women” in the category of interest   ...  In sub-Saharan Africa, the sex ratio at birth is [p1264] approximately 1.03, much lower than for developed countries as a whole (which is 1.06). There appear to be genetic differences that determine this ratio.7   n7 Indeed, the sex ratio at birth for whites in the United States is around 1.06 whereas for blacks it is 1.03. The available data for births from sub-Saharan parents in the United States suggests similar numbers as well.

Russell josiah cox (1948) British medieval population pp147-154 via HarrisBe (1998 in Komlos+) obliquely suggests female infanticide ti explain rising SR 1250 to 1348 and 1430 to 1545

### Language choices (rhetoric/clarity) -- MORTAL NEGLECT & FRAIL MALE
In the context of using sex ratio differences to test for sex discrimination, we use the phrase **mortal neglect** to refer to deliberate and malicious? witholding or withdrawal of the minimal care and attention required to keep an infant or child alive (or prevent them from dying?). This is about the usage of Lynch (), and is quite different from the meaning of the phrase as used earlier by Scheper-Jones (referring to neglect of "doomed infants" -- in which case neglect hastens an imminent death). 
In the context of identifying the biological/physiological bases for male-biased infant and child mortality, we use the phrase "frail male" to refer to the male's greater susceptibility to disease and lesser resilence to malnutrion CONGENITAL STUFF too? IS THIS? This is somewhat narrower than the usage of PSYCH-GUY (DATE) who addresses the broader range of pyshc and emotional needs of boys and men, in the context of arguing for more nuturing? Challenging current stereotypes of masculinity and binaries of gender?   
OLDER COMMENTS^[Choosing our terms: mortal neglect, selective neglect, of girls? If the former, we need to footnote and clarify that we aren't using it in the sense of Scheper-Hughes). Jim's current (200618) sense is we use the term mortal neglect, and **not** in quotation marks. Instead we define mortal neglect as a *lack* of care and attention that substantially increase probability of death (like by 10%-points or more -- issue is additive, not multiplicative). Scheper-Hughes refers to *withdrawal* of care, suggesting initial care that is rescinded).]

###  leads for jim to check


#### Cuba
Seems unlikely for us -- 1950 SR1 not low; not a miserable place ...
Look at 2000ish SR1 of Cuba relative to OECD rich and to Latin America?
Look at before and after revolution ... 
https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Interpolated/  UN World Population Prospects

2017 Gonzalez & Gilleskie, *Demography*  "Using the new methodology, the IMR of Cuba likely ranges between 9.04 and 10.11
infant deaths per 1,000 live births compared with the 5.79 reported officially."  
FRED 2004 values:  Cuba 5.8  Costa Rica 9.2 Chile 7.9    World Bank
We look at SR1 and find ... UN Data is odd, 2004 Cuba SR1 1.08? 

2012  Ward & Devereaux   1953 Cuba middle income ...

also some crappy stuff drawing on G&G's Demography, in *Health Policy and Planning* -- questioning validity of data and arguing for forced abotion Berdine, Gelso, Powell; Hirschfield; seems like politically motivated shit


#### Spain

For lit review only (Tapia & Gallego-Martinez allude to declining SR1 and worsening conditions)
Tapia & Gallego‐Martínez (2017 EEH, 2020 EHR) Use sex-ratios to look gender discrimination; uses European SR04 for comparisons 
2017 p120n22 The decline in the sex ratio during the last third of the 19th century might be related to the worsening of living conditions during the first stages of modern economic growth (Martínez-Carrión and Pérez-Castejón, 2002, 421). 

2020EHR What explains the missing girls in nineteenth-century Spain?   2020EHR repeats 2017 discussion of SR1 and SR04 and Spain's suspiciously high sex ratios. 
2017 p Therefore, instead of around 105.9, infant sex ratios in the absence of gender discrimination should have been expected to be somewhat just below parity (99.4) in mid-19th century Spain.19 
p66  Due to the female biological survival advantage in utero and during infancy, sex ratios should theoretically be lower under severe economic conditions.40 If, on the contrary, economic deprivation shows a positive relationship with the prevalence of boys, it would be evidence of potential gender discrimination, in the form of either female infanticide or the neglect of young girls, especially in terms of nutritional deprivation and susceptibility to infection. It may be the case that both effects offset each other, so the lack of a clear relationship between these variables and the sex ratio might be (cautiously) interpreted as weak evidence of gender bias <br>  n40 OUCH -- cites own EEH -- maybe earlier discussion justifies the cavalier (light) validation/evidence <br>p74 Rather than being the result of female infanticide or the mistreatment of young girls, the excess female mortality discussed here was probably due to an unequal allocation of resources within the household


2017EEH Where are the missing girls? Gender discrimination in 19th-century Spain  
5 The demographic transition in Spain did not start until the late 19th century and the early 20th century (Dopico and Reher, 1998). Anthropometric evidence confirms the deplorable living conditions existent in mid-19th-century Spain. See, for instance, Martínez-Carrión and Pérez-Castejón (2000), Martínez-Carrión (2002) or Moreno-Lázaro (2006)

### Jim's notes on Soviet/Russian Stuff ###

 ? https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/hunger

infant mortality debate -- was 1970s rise of soviet IMR a figment of improved reporting in southern republics (Muslim)? Maybe we can use behavior of SR1 (but a Kyrgistan paper argues for son-preference and selective abortion there, more recently)


Issue for J&J: 1940ish level of health?  short kids, I gather ...  1940 IMR 200 (maybe 250, if add 1/4 for definition correction)

Brainerd  inf mortality & heights; she refers to Mironov, “Diet,” “New Approaches,” and “Birth Weight”; Mironov & A'Hearn, “Russian Living Standards”; and Wheatcroft, “Great Leap” and “First 35 Years.”  p87  ...  Estimates vary widely, but per capita consumption in the USSR likely reached no more than one-third  that of the United States in the mid-1970s, and probably declined in subsequent years.8      Page?

1983
Jones & Grupp p214pdf3 section title  "Soviet infant mortality in  historical perspective"   1909 IMR 297 in European Russia (note 11:(Statistical Reference Book of the USSR for 1928 (Moscow)); "infant death rates in Moscow and St. Petersb were double those of Paris and London" (n12) p215 By 1925 European RSFSR 229   1926 193  1927 217  1917 Ukraine 148 Belorussia 99      "Reported infant mortality for the USSR as a whole was 182 in 1940, up  from 174 in 1926. n19   The higher 1940 figure was probably due to better reporting  of infant deaths in the European areas and the inclusion of data from high- [p216] mortality southern tier areas that had previously been excluded "   Turkmenistan probably higher than the reported 250 in 1939 (n20)       After WWII IM declines in European areas of USSR  Leningrad  1940 196  1945 148 1950 82     p217 RSFSR rate 37 "higher than the reported rates for four of the five Muslim republics for which we have data."(p218)  " The lower reported rates in the southern tier areas were due to faulty  reporting, not better health conditions"  p227 southern tier areas  "Increasingly  complete reporting in these regions produced erratic increases in reported infant  death rates in the 1960s, followed by a dramatic upsurge in reported infant  mortality in the early 1970s."   Some small increase in IMR in Euro-Russia, p233 maybe connected to reduced stillbirths via resusitation  of asphixia victims    Velkoff & Miller largely disagree, claiming it's post neo-natal rural deaths that increase (seems like a non sequitur to me)
