### USA ###

<p>**Spreadsheets** USAkidsForR.xls has national totals; US-KIDSFORR.XLS has state and finer data (and starts with national total white pops 1900-1980), but see also each wrangling/raw for US data used for specific projects. Old (2021.0604) Age25censRegns.xls compiles regional data, NewEng, MidAtl, SouAtl; but often does not give source. I suspect I totalled up the state-level. And it does not isolate white populations except for South</p>

#### SR Population Counts -- checking for inconsistencies

Grove & Lindner (VS1900-40) have states' u1 u5 pops by sex starting pdf885- p872  (Supplement Population Tables USA). This show 1930 & 1940 as in 1940 census -- so VS probably good for white IM etc

   1900-04 t vii by months

<p>PUMS data extracts (on Jim's computer or drive)   </p>
<p>National **white** SR5 discrepencies over 0.1% --  1870 PUMS is 0.3 less male **important** insomuch as it is against our findings;   
1850 fPUMS 103.72  cenVol 103.35  PUMS 0.37% more male (more healthy) -- not likely important; could strengthen ours     
1870 fPUMS 103.04  cenVol 103.34  PUMS 0.30% less male (less healthy) -- potential to weaken our results;   
1900 fPUMS 102.50  cenvol 102.64
1910 fPUMS 102.50  cenVol 102.93  PUMS 0.43% less male (less healthy) -- potential to clarify?

</p><p>1870 
recall that for whites, PUMS 1870 (103.04) is 0.30% less male than the published volume.     

1870 MASS all SR5 fPUMS (100.8) is 0.74 less male than cenVol (101.53). But 1875 state census is 100.9 and 1865 is 101.3. So the 1870 cenVol SR5 may seem high? 
1870 MASS whites SR5 fPUMS ()  is 0.7% less male than CenVol. Looking at single years of age, age 0 is most dramatic, it is 1.7% less male ... if the PUMS SR0 had the cen value, then Mass would be just 0.2 less male ... And that is a matter of 141 infants being moved from female to male ... out of almost 33K infants ...    
Looking at counties, Norfolk is largeish with low male SR 93 with 2K infants; but random sample finds fem-tilt (10/21 in pure random; fuller sample 28/37 ).  Maybe there is a large county that undercounted males in some part? Would need much luck, or district-level PUMS ...      
e.g Boston Wd10 start at i100.     
Age0 91 1 0, 92 0 1, 93 0 0, 94 0 1, 95-103 0 0; 104 0 1, 105 0 0, 106 2 0;  188 1 0, 189 0 0, 190 0 0, 191 1 0, 192 2 0
1870 SR5 all   -- will restricting to white narrow the discreps?
NJ cenVol 102.2 PUMS 101.7  PUMS 0.5% less male; white 0.6% less male (102.4 101.8)     
NY cenVol 101.9 PUMS 101.6  PUMS 0.32% less male; white 0.32% less (101.96 101.63)    
PA cenVol 101.9 PUMS 101.2  PUMS 0.7% less male; white 0.76 less (102.03  101.26)     
MiddAtl whites SR5 PUMS is 0.54% less male than the published census

</p>

<p>1880 -- via Mass IMR prediction, 1880 Mass seems much more male than other years. Both cVol & PUMS are more male (2%)
</p>


<p>**discrepencies** between fPUMS and published volumes include <br>Mass SR5 f-101.5 c-102.0 ; <br>NY white SR5 f-101.4 c-102.1 (SR2 101.9 102.9) ... when time, Jim to randomly sample ...

USimrDRA1910.RDS   Note we have only 1 yr of IMR data to connect to SR (so use SR2?)

Dempap uses full BRA. BRA data for IMR 1920, 1930 -- US totals (but 1920 is Jan 1, so 1920 refers to 1919; before 2021Nov 2, 1920 erroneously included some 1920 IMR). Ji also looked at US-North 1920 (excludes DC) amd   1930 US-North US-Sou-white US-Sou-black.        

USimrBRA.RDS is simply the BRA part of USimr-BRA.xls (which covers 1915-1931); that RDS file was made by EstUSimrDRA.R, and that file reads the u1 deaths counts from USimr-BRA.xls (top part of which is the BRA data) and merges them with the u1 pop counts in US1910SR1.RDS (which was created from 1910 PUMS full-count in 2nd part of buildPUMSurb10.R). That SR1 file has 27 states (tot/urb10k, rur10k)

For 1915 to 1930 (for census SRs of 1920 and 1930), we get IMR by state/race from [Lindner & Grove (1943)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/hist293.htm#:~:text=Lindner%20FE%2C%20Grove,the%20Census.%201943%3B) Vital statistics rates in the United States, 1900-1940. We use annual Birth Statistics pubs to get birth counts. Oddly, [Hetzel's](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/other/miscpub/vsushist.htm) history of US vital statistics systems has SC starting in DRA 1916 and BRA 1919, yet SC not in Birth Stats 1926

For 1931 we have both the B-SB-IM-BRA and Mortality Statistics, and they give same u1 death count for Illinois (which serves to confirm same data, for me)    
     -17 Stillbirths; Tables 18-20 cover whole BRA;   
  Table 21 give State-level deaths by causes, and by ages (u1day, 1, 2, 3-6 days, 1wk etc)     
Table 22 gives States' total/cities/incorps/rural with >10K and >2.5k as cutoffs.  And deaths are by sex. 

Table 23 has that same 3-way breakdown, for deaths by days/weeks/months

<H4> **DRA Mortality Statistics** </H4> 

[Appendix](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/misc/usvss.pdf) to US VSSS  offers history of DRA and BRA.     
p57  Growth of the Birth- and Death-Registration Areas      
  ... In 1880, the Bureau of the Census established a national ‘‘registration area’’ for deaths. This original area consisted of only two States—Massachusetts and New Jersey—the District of Columbia, and several large cities having efficient systems for the registration of deaths
     
p58 Table 1.01 lists dates for "Records on file for entire area (columns: Deaths Births"      
DC 1855 1871     MA 1841 1841    MI 1867 1867   NH 1850 1850    NJ 1848 1848    RI 1852 1852    VT 1857 1857      
but MI not into DRA until 1900 -- hmm

Condran & Crimmins 1979 Hi Methods    on quality of census mortality data 1850-1900.  Ji looks through 2022.0811 and tends to be discouraged from trying to use data from before 1900 ...     
  safe to say 1850 1860 1870 almost all from retrospective (not registration) Ji: BUT that seems to be supposition -- wonder e.g. about MI, NJ,  as well as MA
  in 1880 and 1890 registration data in place on enumer data for entire DRA   
  in 1900, reg data regarded as suff complete to be used in the census report only in CT MA NH and certain counties and cities in NY and NJ -- deaths not enumerated in the census.  remaining parts of DRA mort collected on census schedules,  returns compared to reg returns  The enum returns used to add unregistered deaths to the mort totals   fill in missing data on reg record ... a mixture of enumerated and registered deaths.    1880 and 1890 register of deaths solicited from physicians / added to returns from census enumerations.

For 1900 we have both the census-year deaths and the calendar year.     
We use table 19  pp  285-555 (pdf 598-868)  -- p xi rates reported when "the results are fairly comparable; for the nonregistration (enumeration) areas the insufficiency of the data are indicated by an asterisk (*).

p xiv in many cases there were actually fewer deaths recorded in the later years of the decade 1890-1900 than were recorded in 1890, notwithstanding large increases in population.  ... decision to have the enumerators make inquiry and return deaths in all areas where any doubt of the sufficiency of registration existed, in order to use the information as a check upon the accuracy of registration, and to supplement and complete the registration returns if found defective in numbers or in detail.   
     The registration record was accepted as sufficiently complete and satisfactory in Mass, CT, RI, and NH; certain counties in the state of NY, nameley Broome, Columbia, ... cities: Albany, Cohoes, NY (greater), ... and certain counties and cities in the state of NJ ...
<br>In these areas the mortality schedule was withdrawn from the enumerators. In all others they were directed to report deaths, and their returns ... compared with the reg records. The result of the comparisons, ... indicated that registration was defective in many places where it was supposed to be perfect, a considerable percentage of the deaths reported by the enumerators not being found in the reg record. As the enumerators did not report more than 50 or 60 per cent of the deaths, the presumption is strong that the omissions in the registration record were even greater than indicated.

##### Mass IMR 

Haines (1998:231) Unfortunately, collection of vital statistics was left to individual states and municipalities, which resulted in tardy and uneven coverage. Massachusetts was the first to begin this activity at the state level in 1842 and achieved relatively good coverage by about 1855 (Abbott, 1897:714-715). 

Abbott 1897:714 The period of forty years (1856–95) has been selected for consideration for the reason that it presents a definite portion of time in which the returns of vital statistics of the cities and towns may be deemed to be fairly accurate. The returns of the first few years following 1842 are more or less incomplete and untrustworthy, but those of the forty years under consideration must be considered as approximately correct.

<br> Note: arguably, the rural data are perhaps not "deemed to be fairly accurate" ?

Haines (2006 HSUS essay) The Massachusetts data reach reasonable quality by about 1860 and are reproduced here in Tables Ab928 and Ab1048–1058.

For our black SR02 in 1950 (100.9), we reduced the nonwhite value by 0.1, based on the difference between the negro and nonwhite sex-ratios for under-age-5 (via Table 97). A 1950 black SR02 of 101.0 results from applying the same correction to the nonwhite SR02 from the spredsheet for 1950 in the National Intercensal Tables: 1900-1990 (released in 2004). </p>
<p> PE-11 has Nonwhite SR2 is 101.1, census has 101.0 </p>

See above in [DRA section](#DRAsect) for mortality data from 1890 census

Ages were to be asked as "age at nearest birthday" so the data are not consistent with 1880 or 1900 (and there are the manuscripts were destroyed by fire). Looking across 1880 to 1910 by state, some states seem plausible, a few seem odd, in terms of SR5 values over time.

### US Census for the Black SR1 ###
population volumes from 1850 and 1860 give U1, 1-u5, 5-u10 etc, for Whites, Free Colored Slaves.  Negro Population 1790-1915 Ch 4 provides SR1 for blacks 1850, 1860, 1870, 1900, 1910 and explains that 1880 and 1890 includes "indians, chinese, japanese" with blacks. So we need to extrapolate to fill in -- calculate non-white totals 

1940 can't find negro age 2 -- just nonwhite for single yr

1902 VS annual report indicates that birth enumeration is flawed:    
  
     The usual comparison of births and deaths, their difference constituting what is known as the natural increase of population, cannot be made, since the improved accuracy of the returns of deaths removes them from the plane of comparison with the very imperfect returns of births.

<p>***UNDERCOUNTING of Children *** Underenumeration of infants and children? Hacker (2003) relies on PUMS samples for 1850-1870, which we doubt for SR data. Earlier work on fertility refers to infants, but the empirical work and estimates work with 5-yr groups (u5, 5-9, etc). See LIT for Thompson & Whelpton (1933), Yasuba, Coale & Zelnick, Land et al., Hacker.
