<h2>Bike Computer Options for Jesse's Birthday </h2>
<h5><i>(parents propose to purchase preferred cyling computer) </i></h5>
<p>This <a href="https://bikexchange.com/best-bike-speedometer-computer/">page at BIKEXCHANGE</a> has reviews of bike computers. I suspect you want wireless (avoid running a wire up the front forks from the sensor to the computer), which would rule out the cheapest options. But there seem to be good options for $100 or less (with added costs if you want heart-monitor functionality?)
	For urban use, I bet you want it easily removed. Otherwise, I'm agnostic on key parameters such as: battery or USB-chargeable; small or large display; specific features ... </p>
	<p>There are some promising <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/equipment/bike-accessories/bike-computers-gps/bike-computers/bontrager-ridetime-elite-cycling-computer/p/21830/" target="_blank"
>options from Trek</a>,which is the brand I used when I was cycling as cross-training for running.</p>
<p>And finally, one more <a href="https://bikemunk.com/best-speedometers-for-bicycles-reviews/" target="_blank">set of reviews</a>, from bikemunk (but I have a vague recollection that these reviews weren't so useful).
