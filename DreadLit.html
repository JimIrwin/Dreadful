<p>Ingemarsson's <a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1471-0528.2003.00022.x" target="_blank"><big><b>"Gender aspects of preterm birth"</b></big></a> (2003 BJOG) has a series of useful points for us.</p>
<p>1) Potentially relevant to stillbirth effects, Sweden 1999-2000 infant mortality among preemies (born at 23-24 weeks) was 55% for males and 32% for females (<a href="#IngPreem">Still Births and One‐Year Mortality</a>).</p>
<p>2) Sex ratio of 1.32 in spontaneous abortions of chromosonally (<a href="#IngSA">Spontaneous Abortions</a>).</p>
<p>3) Sex ratio of 1.06 reported by <a href=https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1471-0528.2003.00022.x#b1" target="_blank">Maconochie and Roman</a>. They also see gender determination as a chance process -- ? that must mean they are looking at healthy Swedes with decent incomes? (else frail male plays a role)?
4) Evidence to remind that at small IMRs, the SR1 won't show the frail-male effect. Sweden 1999-2000, IMR male 3.44 and female 2.18; at so low an IMR, the effect on the SR is tiny. Among births with at least 28 weeks gestation (or less if live-born), stillbirth rates per 1000 were 3.8 males and 3.9 females, ? but greater subsequent mortality?<p>       

<p><a name="IngSB"><b>Still Births and One‐Year Mortality</b></a> Since 1973, data from all deliveries in Sweden have been registered in a national medical birth registry. Included were pregnancies with a gestational duration of at least 28 completed weeks or less if the infant was alive at birth. National figures have been analysed from 1999–2000, which consisted of 175,382 newborns, of which 672 were stillbirth. The stillbirth rate was similar among male fetuses (3.8 per 1000) compared with female ones (3.9 per 1000). However, there was a greater than 50% increase in the number of male infants dying neonatally or within one year. In total, the rate of mortality up to one year was 3.44 per 1000 for males compared with 2.18 per 1000 for females.

<p><a name="IngPreem"><b><i>Preemies</i></b></a> In Sweden 1999–2000, 2277 infants were born alive between 24 and 32 gestational weeks. Of these, 55% were males and 45% were females. The difference in neonatal mortality was, however, greater in males (9.1%) compared with females (5.6%). The difference was even greater at extremely early gestational ages, between 23 and 24 weeks, with a one‐year infant mortality rate for males of 55% compared with 32% in females.</p>
<p><a name="IngSA"><b>Spntaneous Abortions</b></a> Chromosome analysis of spontaneous abortions may be marred by errors, due to the high rate of chromosome abnormalities and possible contamination with maternal tissues. However Hassold et al.8 estimated that the male : female sex ratio was 1.32 of chromosomally normal, spontaneous abortions i.e. a 30% increased risk for male fetuses.</p>
<p>
<a name="IngSR"><b>Sex Ratio</b></a> It has been suggested that certain biological and environmental factors may have an impact on the sex of the baby. Numerous studies have reported associations with birth order, parental age, social class, paternal occupation, season of birth, and calendar period of delivery. However, in a large population study, Maconochie and Roman found no evidence that gender determination was anything other than a chance process1. The sex ratio male versus female was 1.06 in a population of 549,048 births. The sex ratio was unrelated to gender of preceding siblings, maternal age, maternal height, maternal social class, and year of delivery and season of birth. <a href=https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1471-0528.2003.00022.x#b1" target="_blank">Maconochie and Roman</a>
